<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Hathaway's home-ranch spread
itself miles over an open valley on the
upper Missouri. As far as the eye
reached not a fence could be seen, yet four
barbed-wires, stretched upon good cotton-wood
posts, separated the ranch from the open
country about.</p>

<p>Jim Hathaway was an old-time cattle-man.
He still continued each summer to turn out
upon the range great droves of Texas steers
driven north by his cowboys, though at this
time it was more profitable to ship in Western
grown stock. He must have known that this
was so, for every year his profits became less,
yet it was the nature of the man to keep in the
old ruts, to cling to old habits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The old-time cowboy was fast disappearing,
customs of the once wild West were giving
way before an advancing civilization. He had
seen its slow, steady approach year after year,
dreading&mdash;abhorring it. Civilization was coming
surely. What though his lands extended
beyond his good eyesight, were not these interlopers
squatting on every mile of creek in the
surrounding country? The open range would
some time be a thing of the past. That green
ridge of mountains to the west,&mdash;<i>his</i> mountains,
his and the Indians, where he had enjoyed
unmolested reign for many years,&mdash;were
they not filling them as bees fill a hive, so filling
them with their offensive bands of sheep and
small cow-ranches that his cattle had all they
could do to obtain a footing?</p>

<p>On one of his daily rides he had come home
tired and out of humor. The discovery of a
new fence near his boundary line had opened
up an unpleasant train of thought, and not
even the whisky, placed beside him by a
placid-faced Chinese servant, could bring him
into his usual jovial spirits. After glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
through a week-old newspaper and finding in
it no solace for his ugly mood, he threw himself
down upon his office lounge, spreading the
paper carefully over him. The Chinaman, by
rare intuition, divined his state of mind and
stole cautiously into the room to remove the
empty glasses, at the same time keeping his
eyes fixed upon the large man under the newspaper.</p>

<p>Hathaway generally took a nap in the forenoon
after returning from his ride, for he was
an early riser, and late hours at night made this
habit imperative. This day his mood brought
him into a condition where he felt no desire to
sleep, so he concluded, but he must have fallen
into a doze, for the sharp tones of a girl's voice
directly outside his window brought him to his
feet with a start.</p>

<p>"If that's what you're driving at you may as
well roll up your bedding and move on!" It
was spoken vehemently, with all the distinctness
of a clear-toned voice. A man replied,
but in more guarded tone, so that Hathaway
went to the window to catch his words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking
about," he was saying. "This is my home as
well as yours, and I'd have small chance to
carry out my word if I went away, so I intend
to stay right here. Do you know, Hope,
when you get mad like that you're so devilish
pretty that I almost hate you! Look at those
eyes! You'd kill me if you could, wouldn't
you? But you'll love me yet, and marry me,
too, don't forget that!"</p>

<p>"How can you talk to me so," demanded the
girl, stepping back from him, "after all my
father has done,&mdash;made you his son,&mdash;given
you everything he would have given a son?
Oh!" she cried passionately, "I can't <i>bear</i> you
in this new rôle! It is terrible, and I've looked
upon you as a <i>brother</i>! Now what are you?
You've got no right to talk to me so&mdash;to insist!"</p>

<p>"But your mother&mdash;&mdash;" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"My <i>mother</i>!" weariedly. "Yes, of course!
It would be all right there. You have money&mdash;enough.
A good enough match, no doubt;
and she would be freer to go,&mdash;would feel bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>ter
to know that she had no more responsibility
here. You know your ground well enough
<i>there</i>." Then with growing anger: "Don't
you ring in my mother on me! I tell you I
wouldn't marry you if I <i>never</i> got married!
I'm strong enough to fight my own battles, and
I will, and you'd better forget what you've
said to me and change the subject forever!"
She walked away, her strong, lithe body erect.</p>

<p>"But you're handsome, you brown devil!"
he cried, taking one step and clasping her
roughly to him. She tore herself loose, her
eyes blazing with sudden fire, as Hathaway,
white with anger, came suddenly around the
corner of his office and grasped the offender
by the coat collar. Then the slim young man
was lifted, kicked, and tossed alternately from
off the earth, while the girl stood calmly to one
side and watched the performance, which did
not cease until the infuriated man became exhausted.
Then the boy picked himself up and
walked unsteadily toward the building, against
which he leaned to regain his breath while
Hathaway stood panting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, hold on a minute," roared the angry
father as the young man moved away. "I
ain't done with you yet! Get your horse and
get off this ranch or I'll break every bone in
your damn body! You will treat my girl like
that, will you? You young puppy!" The
young fellow was whipped undoubtedly, but
gracefully, for he turned toward Hathaway
and said between swollen lips:</p>

<p>"You don't want to blame me too much,
Uncle Jim. Just look at the girl! Any man
would find it worth risking his neck for her!"
Then he moved slowly away, while the girl's
eyes changed from stern to merry. Her father
choked with rage.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;Get away from
here, and don't talk back to me!" he roared at
the retreating figure.</p>

<p>The girl moved forward a few steps, calling:
"That's right, Sydney, keep your nerve!
When you're ready to call it off we'll try to be
friends again." Without waiting for her
cousin's reply she ran into the house, while he
lost no time in leaving the ranch, riding at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
rapid gait toward the nearest town. Hathaway
watched him out of sight, then with a
nervous, bewildered shake of the head joined
his wife and daughter at luncheon.</p>

<p>"At last your father has come," sighed Mrs.
Hathaway, as he appeared. "Hope, ring for
the chocolate; I'm almost famished. It seems
to me, James," turning to her husband with
some impatience, "that you might <i>try</i> to be a
little more prompt in getting to your meals&mdash;here
we've been waiting ages! You know I
can't bear to wait for anyone!" She sighed
properly and unfolded her napkin.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Hathaway blandly, "I'm
sorry to have kept you waiting, but I've been
somewhat occupied&mdash;somewhat."</p>

<p>"But you should always consider that your
meals come first, even if your wife and family
do not," continued the lady. "Where is Sydney?
The dear boy is generally so very
prompt."</p>

<p>The effect of her words was not apparent.
Her husband appeared absent-minded and the
meal began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The daughter, Hope, with quiet dignity befitting
a matron, occupied the head of the table,
as she had done ever since her mother shifted
the responsibilities of the household to her
young shoulders. When this question was
asked she gave her father a quick glance.
Would he acknowledge the truth? Evidently
not, for he began immediately to talk about the
new fence near his boundary line. It was a
shame, he said, that these people were settling
in around him.</p>

<p>"The land's no good," he declared. "Nearly
all the water around here that's any account is
on my place. All on earth these hobos are taking
it up for is in expectation that I'll buy
them out. Well, maybe I will, and again
maybe I won't. I'd do most anything to get
rid of them, but I can't buy the earth." At
this Hope smiled, showing a flash of strong,
white teeth.</p>

<p>"And if you could buy the earth, what would
you do with these people?" she asked, her face
settling into its natural quiet. Her mother
gave her the usual look of amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hope, I must ask you not to say impertinent
things to your father. You no doubt
meant to be witty, but you were none the less
rude. Why do you allow her to say such
things to you, James? You have succeeded in
spoiling her completely. Now if <i>I</i> had been
allowed to send her away to school she would
have grown up with better manners."</p>

<p>Hathaway passed his cup to be refilled, making
no answer to his wife's outburst. Perhaps
he had learned in his years of experience
that the less said the better. At any rate he
made no effort to defend his daughter&mdash;his
only child, and dear to him, too. If she had
expected that he would defend her it was only
for a passing instant, then she returned to her
natural gravity. Her face had few expressions.
Its chief charm lay in its unchanging
immobility, its utter quiet, behind which
gleamed something of the girl's soul. When
her rare smile came, lighting it up wonderfully,
she was irresistible&mdash;in her anger, magnificent.</p>

<p>Ordinarily she would not have been noticed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
first glance, except, perhaps, for the exceptionally
fine poise of her strong, slim body. She
was a true daughter of the West, tanned
almost as brown as an Indian maid, and easily
might have passed for a half-breed, with her
blue-black eyes and hair of the darkest brown.
But if she had Indian blood she did not know
it. Her mother, during the season, a flitting
butterfly of New York society, a Daughter
of the Revolution by half a dozen lines of
descent, would have been horrified at the mere
thought.</p>

<p>The girl herself would not have cared had
she been born and raised in an Indian camp.
She had what Mrs. Hathaway termed queer
ideas, due, as she always took occasion to explain
to her friends who visited the ranch, to
the uncivilized life that she had insisted upon
living.</p>

<p>Hope had been obstinate in refusing to leave
the ranch. Threats and punishments were unavailing.
When a young child she had resolved
never to go away to school, and had set
her small foot down so firmly that her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was obliged to yield. Hathaway was secretly
glad of this, for the ranch was home to him,
and he would not leave it for any length of
time.</p>

<p>The little girl was great company to him,
for his wife was away months at a time,
preferring the gayety of her New York home
to the quiet, isolated ranch on the prairie.
Some people were unkind enough to say that it
was a relief to Hathaway to have the place to
himself, and certain it is that he never made
any objections to the arrangement. Their
only child, Hope, was educated on the ranch
by the best instructors procurable, and readily
acquired all the education that was necessary
to her happiness.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Hathaway's outburst the girl made
no effort to defend herself, and was well aware
from former experiences that her father would
not come to her aid. That he was afraid of
her mother she would not admit. It seemed so
weak and foolish. She had exalted ideas of
what a man should be. That her father fell
below her standard she would not acknowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
She loved him so, was proud of his good points,
and in many ways he was a remarkable man,
his greatest weakness, if it could be called that,
being his apparent fear of his wife. Her dominion
over him, during her occasional visits
at the ranch, was absolute. Hope shut her
eyes to this, telling herself that it was caused
by his desire to make her happy during these
rare opportunities.</p>

<p>Hathaway did not respond to his wife's
somewhat uncalled-for remarks, but after a
moment of silence adroitly changed the subject
by inquiring of Hope who it was that had
ridden up to the ranch just as he left that
morning.</p>

<p>"It must have been Joe Harris, from the
mountains," she replied, "for he was here
shortly after you rode away. I thought he
was out hunting those cattle of his that I saw
over on Ten Mile the other day, but he informed
me that it was not cattle he was hunting
this time, but a <i>school-teacher</i>. They have
some sort of a country school up there in his
neighborhood, and I think, from what he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and what some of the boys told me, that he
must be the whole school board&mdash;clerk, trustees,
and everything. He was on his way over
to the Cross Bar ranch to see if he could secure
that young fellow who came out from the East
last fall. One of the boys told him that this
young man had given up his calling indefinitely
and was going on the round-up instead,
but Harris rode on to try what persuasion
would do."</p>

<p>"That <i>dreadful</i> man," sighed Mrs. Hathaway.
"He is that <i>squaw-man</i> with those
<i>terrible</i> children! Hope, I wish you wouldn't
talk so intimately with such people; it's below
your dignity. If Sydney were here he would
agree with me. Where <i>is</i> Sydney? Do you
know where he went? He will miss his luncheon
entirely, the poor boy!"</p>

<p>Hope looked searchingly at her father, but
he ignored her glance. Surely he would say
something now! The question trembled upon
the air, but she waited involuntarily for him to
speak.</p>

<p>"I've asked you a question, Hope. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
don't you answer; are you dumb?" said her
mother, with a show of impatience. "Where
<i>is</i> Sydney?"</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>just</i> where he is," replied the
girl at length, "but I think it would be safe to
say that he is riding toward town; at least
he was heading that way the last I saw of
him."</p>

<p>"Toward town!" gasped her mother.
"Why, he was going to drive in for the Cresmonds
to-morrow! You must be mistaken.
Please do not include me in your jokes!"
Then, turning to Hathaway, continued:
"James, where <i>did</i> he go?"</p>

<p>Hathaway moved uneasily under the direct
gaze of his daughter. "I haven't the least
idea," he finally answered. "I can't keep
track of everyone on the ranch." The girl's
face turned pale under her tan. She rose
from the table and stood tall and straight behind
her chair, her clear eyes direct upon her
father.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell her," she cried with passion.
Then the usual calm settled over her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
She turned to her mother. "I may as well tell
you that we had a little scene this morning,
Sydney and I. He proposed to me." She
hesitated an instant, turned and caught her
father's nervous, anxious look direct. He
was watching her uneasily. She continued
deliberately: "I refused him&mdash;and sent him
away from the ranch. You may as well know
all about it."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> sent him away from the ranch,"
gasped Mrs. Hathaway.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the girl quietly. It was
her first lie.</p>

<p>"You <i>dared</i> send him away&mdash;away from his
own home!" almost screamed Mrs. Hathaway,
her rage increasing with every word. "<i>You
dared!</i> <i>You</i>, my own daughter&mdash;ungrateful,
inconsiderate&mdash;&mdash;You <i>know</i> how I love
that boy, my poor Jennie's son! What business
had you sending him away, or even refusing
him, I'd like to know! What if he is your
cousin&mdash;your second cousin? Oh, you have no
consideration for me, <i>none</i>&mdash;you never had!
How can I ever endure it here on this ranch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
three whole months without Sydney! It was
bad enough before!" She wrung her hands
and rose sobbing from the table. "James, do
go after that poor boy. Say that I am willing
he should marry Hope if he is so foolish
as to want her. Tell him not to mind anything
she says, but that he <i>must</i> come home.
You will go at once, won't you?"</p>

<p>She placed both hands imploringly on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go after him to-morrow, so stop
your worrying," he answered soothingly.
"Hope, fetch your mother a glass of wine,
don't you see she's all upset?"</p>

<p>The girl brought the wine and handed it to
her father, but his eyes shifted uneasily from
her clear, steady ones. He led his unhappy
wife from the room, leaving Hope alone with
the empty wine glass in her hand. She stood
so for a moment, then walked to the table and
set the tiny glass down, but, oddly, raised it up
again and looked at it closely.</p>

<p>"As empty as my life is now," she thought.
"As empty as this home is for me. I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
one&mdash;father, mother&mdash;no one." A queer look
crossed her face; determination settled over
her, as with a sudden, vehement motion she
shattered the frail glass upon the floor. A
single thought, and a new life had opened before
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Upon the slope of a great grass-covered
hill, among other hills, larger
and grass-covered also, stood a small
log school-house. A hundred yards away, between
this isolated building and the dingy road
stretched through the mountain valley, grew a
scrubby clump of choke-cherry brush. Some
boys crouched low upon the ground behind
these bushes, screened from sight of possible
passers-by, and three pairs of eyes looked
through the budding branches, intently scanning
the road at the crest of hill to the left.
Finally a dark speck appeared upon its gray
surface. The youngest boy shivered, a tightening
of expression came over the leader's face.
He drew his shotgun closer to him, resting it
upon his knees. Suddenly he laughed unpleasantly
and kicked the child who had
shivered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ninny, quit your shakin'! Can't you
tell a steer from a man? You'll make a nice
feller when you grow up, 'fraid of your own
shadow! You'd better git into the school-house
an' hide under a bench, if you're goin' to
be scared out of your skin. Baby! Umph, a
<i>steer</i>, too! That blame black one that won't
stay with the bunch!" The big boy brought
his awkward length down upon the ground,
continuing in a lower tone: "I'd a darn sight
ruther be on my horse drivin' him back on the
range than waitin' here for any fool school-teacher!
But we've got this job on hand. No
schoolin' for me&mdash;I'm too old. It'll do for
babies that shiver at a steer, but I've got other
business, an' so's Dan. I'm thinkin' if the old
man wants school up here he'll have to teach it
himself! What does he think we'd go to the
trouble of running away from the Mission for
if we wanted to go to school? Umph, he must
think we're plumb locoed!"</p>

<p>"If father catches us in this he'll lick us to
death," interposed the youngest boy.</p>

<p>"Not much, he won't. He'll have to ride a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
faster horse than mine or Dan's if he catches
us! We'll ride over to the Indian camp, an'
you can stay here an' take the lickin'! He'll
be glad enough to see us come back in a month
or two, I'll bet! And he's goin' to find out
right now that it ain't no use to bring any doggoned
teacher up here to teach this outfit.
Ain't that so, Dan? We know enough of
learnin'. I bet this new fellow won't stay
long enough to catch his breath!"</p>

<p>A boy, who in looks and size was the exact
counterpart of the speaker, asked in a sweet,
soft-toned voice: "What if the old man takes
a notion to come along to the school-house with
him&mdash;what'll we do then, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Do! why, what do you suppose we'll do?"
answered his twin, settling down closer to the
ground. "Why, we'll hide these here guns
an' walk up to the school-house like little sheep,
and <i>then</i> lay low and watch our chance when
the old man <i>ain't</i> around. I ain't figurin' on
any lickin' to-day, you can bet your boots on
that, but I'll take a darn good one before any
more schoolin'! We've got the medicine to fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
school-teachers for him this year, I reckon!"
And patting his gun, the breed boy gave a
satisfied grunt and settled down nearer to the
ground.</p>

<p>"You bet we have," softly assented his twin.
"But what if the fellow don't scare at them
blank cartridges?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll try duck-shot on him," answered
the first readily. "What'd you think&mdash;we're
a lot of babies? I reckon we've got
fight in us! You've got to stick to us, Ned,
even if you ain't as old as Dan and me. Ain't
that so, Dan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless he wants to get whaled half
to death," sweetly answered the soft-voiced
twin.</p>

<p>"I'm no coward," exclaimed the sturdy little
fellow. "If you boys <i>dare</i> lick me I'll shoot
the two of you!" His small black eyes flashed
ominously. For an instant he glared at the
older boys, all the savagery in his young soul
expressed in his countenance. The soft-voiced
twin gave a short laugh. Something
like admiration shone in his eyes for the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
lad, but he retorted sweetly: "You shivered!
Don't you go an' do it again!" At that instant
his sharp eyes sighted an object just appearing
at the top of the hill. He punched the
leader vigorously: "Now down on your
knees, he's comin' sure this time!"</p>

<p>"And he's alone," said the bold leader joyfully.
"We won't have no trouble with him.
He rides like a tenderfoot, all right. Wait till
he gets down by that rock there, then let him
have it, one after the other&mdash;first me, then
Dan, then you, Ned. I'll bet my horse an'
saddle that he'll go back quicker'n he's
comin'!"</p>

<p>"What if that ain't the feller we want?"
gently asked Dan.</p>

<p>"We'll wait till he turns in here, an' then
we'll know. They ain't nobody else goin' to
come along this way just now. Lord, don't he
ride slow, though! Now I'll shoot first, don't
forget."</p>

<p>"His saddle blanket's flying on this side, and
he's got a red shirt on," said the other twin.
"He's lookin' over this way. Yes, he's comin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
here all right. Let him have it, Dave, before
he gits any closer!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the approaching rider left the
main road and turned up the dimly marked
trail toward the school-house. The forward
twin waited an instant, then, aiming his shotgun
carelessly toward the stranger, fired. At
the signal a volley rang out from behind the
bushes. As quickly the horse took fright,
stopped stock still, then wheeled, and bolted
with utmost speed directly toward the patch of
brush, passing so near that the boys drew in
their legs and crawled snake-like under the
protection of the branches.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," gasped the leader, as the
horse raced past, on up the grassy slope of a
hill, "it's a girl!"</p>

<p>Two minutes later the bushes were quickly
parted over three very uncomfortable boys,
and a red shirt-waisted girl looked sternly in at
them.</p>

<p>"You boys come out of there this minute!
Who did you take me for that you were trying
to frighten me to death? Or is that the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
you treat ladies up here in the mountains?
Come out immediately and explain yourselves!"</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin crept out first, and before
scrambling to his feet began apologizing:
"We didn't know it was <i>you</i>. We thought it
was a man. Don't hurt us! We wouldn't a
done it for nothin' if we'd thought it was you.
We were layin' for a school-teacher that father
got to teach this school, an' we took you for
him." Then more hopefully as he regained his
feet: "But our guns wasn't loaded with
nothing but blank cartridges. We was just
goin' to frighten him away so that we wouldn't
have no school this summer. It's too fine
weather to be in school, anyway." He looked
up into the girl's uncompromising face. "But
now I reckon our hides are cooked, for you'll
tell your father." This last questioningly.</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't like my father to know
about this&mdash;or <i>your</i> father either, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"We'd do most anything if you wouldn't
tell on us, Miss Hathaway!"</p>

<p>"Do I look like a girl that would tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
things?" she flashed back. "I usually fight
my own battles; if necessary, I can use <i>this</i>."
A quick movement and she placed before their
faces a reliable looking six-shooter.</p>

<p>"We know all about that! You ain't a-goin'
to hurt us, are you?" exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>"You know all about <i>that</i>, do you? Well,
that's good. Now tell me your names."</p>

<p>"We're the Harris kids," answered Dave
quickly.</p>

<p>"I know you're the Harris kids, but I want
your first names. <i>Yours</i>," she commanded,
looking at the soft-voiced twin and absently
fingering the weapon.</p>

<p>"Mine's Dan. <i>He's</i> Dave, an' that one's
Ned," answered the boy in one soft, quick
breath; then added: "We know all about how
you can shoot. You're a dead one!" His
face took on a certain shrewd look and he continued
divertingly: "I'll throw up my cap
an' you shoot at it. I'd like to have the hole
in it."</p>

<p>Miss Hathaway seemed suddenly amused.</p>

<p>"You are a very bright boy! And your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
name is Dan&mdash;Daniel. You want a souvenir?
Well, all right, but not just now. I've got
other business. I came to teach your school."
She hesitated, looking keenly at their astonished
faces. "Yes, your father has engaged
me&mdash;hired me, so I think we'd better go
inside and begin work, don't you? We'll
overlook this shooting affair. I don't know as
I blame you very much for not wanting a man
teacher, but of course the shooting was very
wrong, and you shouldn't have tried to frighten
anyone; but we'll forget all about it. But you
are not going to have a man teacher, and I am
different. I am going to live at your house,
too, so of course we'll be good friends&mdash;ride
together, hunt, and have great times, <i>after
school</i>. During school we <i>work</i>, remember
that! Now one of you boys please stake out
my horse for me and then we will go inside and
start school. You boys must help me get
things to working."</p>

<p>Before she had finished speaking the soft-voiced
twin caught her horse, which was grazing
near. Dave, more clumsily built, fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>lowed
him, while the girl took the small boy by
the hand and started toward the school-house.
At the door she turned in time to see the twins
struggling at her horse's head. They were
about ready to come to blows.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that horse myself," said
Dave gruffly, attempting to force the other
boy's hand from the bridle.</p>

<p>"Don't fight, boys, or <i>I</i> will take care of the
horse," called the new school-teacher severely;
thereupon the soft-voiced twin released his hold
and walked demurely up to the school-house.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he explained as he went inside,
"Dave's the youngest, and so I let him have
the horse."</p>

<p>"I never was so frightened in my life,"
thought the girl, as she arranged the small
school for the day. "But the only way to
manage these little devils is to bluff them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>A group composed principally of
cowboys, squaw-men, and breeds
squatted and lounged outside of Joe
Harris' house. Numerous tousley-headed
boys, with worn overalls and bare feet, played
noisily on the outskirts, dogs and pigs scurried
about everywhere, while in the doorway of the
dingy, dirt-covered kitchen in the rear hovered
a couple of Indian women and several
small dark-skinned children. Somewhere out
of sight, probably over the cook-stove, were
two or three nearly grown girls. Such, at
supper time, was the usual aspect of Joe
Harris' cabins, varied occasionally by more or
less Indians, whose tepees stood at one side, or
more or less dogs, but always the same extraordinary
amount of squealing pigs and children.</p>

<p>The huge figure of Joe Harris, squaw-man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
cattle-man, and general progressive-man, was
prominent in the center of the group. He was
by all odds the greatest and most feared man
in that portion of the country. His judgment
as well as his friendship was sought after by
all the small ranchers about, and also, it was
rumored, by a certain class of cattle owners
commonly called rustlers. To be Joe Harris'
friend meant safety, if nothing more; to be his
enemy meant, sooner or later, a search for a new
country, or utter ruination. He brought with
him, years before from the north, a weird record,
no tangible tale of which got about, but
the mysterious rumor, combined with the man's
striking personality, his huge form, bearded
face, piercing blue eyes, and great voice, all
combined to make people afraid of him. He
was considered a dangerous man. At this
date he possessed one thousand head of good
cattle, a squaw, and fifteen strong, husky children,
and, being a drinking man, possessed also
an erratic disposition. He was very deferential
to his Indian wife, a good woman, but he
ruled his offspring with a rod of iron. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
children feared him. Some of them possessed
his nature to such a marked degree that they
hated him more than they feared him, which is
saying considerable. Even as they played
about the group of men they watched him
closely, as they had learned by instinct at their
mother's breast.</p>

<p>In the midst of loud talk from the assorted
group, a tiny girl, the great man's favorite
child, was sent out from the kitchen to tell them
that supper was ready. The little thing pulled
timidly at the large man's coat. He stooped
and picked her up in his arms, leading the
hungry throng into the house, where a rude
supper was eaten in almost absolute silence.
Occasionally a pig would venture into the
room, to be immediately kicked out by the
man who sat nearest the door. Then the
children that played about the house would
chase the offending animal with sticks and
shrill cries.</p>

<p>In a room adjoining this one a girl sat alone
in dejected attitude, her face buried between
two very brown hands. As the men tramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
into the house she rose from the trunk upon
which she had been sitting and crossed to the
farther side of the room. There, with difficulty,
she forced up a small dingy window
looking out upon the mountains at the back of
the ranch&mdash;a clear view, unobstructed by
scurrying dogs, pigs, or children. She leaned
far out, drawing in deep, sweet breaths, and
wondering if she would follow the impulse to
climb out and run to the top of the nearest hill.
She thought not, then fell again to wondering
how she should ever accustom herself to this
place, these new surroundings. She heard the
men tramp out of the house, followed soon by
a timid rap upon her door, then moved quickly
across the room, an odd contrast to her rude
surroundings.</p>

<p>"You can have supper now," said a tall girl
in a timid voice. "The men are through. We
ain't got much, Miss Hathaway."</p>

<p>"A little is enough for me," said the girl,
smiling. "Don't call me <i>Miss</i>, please. It
doesn't seem just right&mdash;<i>here</i>. Call me Hope.
It will make me feel more at home, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
You're <i>Mary</i>, aren't you? <i>You</i> haven't been
to supper, have you?"</p>

<p>"Mother said you were to eat alone," answered
the breed girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, surely I may eat with you girls!
I'd much prefer it. You know it would be
lonely all by myself, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"We ain't going to eat just yet, not till
after the boys get theirs," said the Harris girl
a trifle less timidly.</p>

<p>"Then I will wait, too," Hope decided.
"Come in, Mary, and stay till I unpack some
of these things. Just a few waists and extra
riding skirts. I suppose I am to hang them
up here on these nails, am I not?" When she
had finished unpacking she turned to the breed
girl, who had become quite friendly and was
watching her interestedly, and explained:
"Just a few things that I thought would be
suitable to wear up here, for teaching; but,
do you know, I'd feel lots better if I had a
dress like yours&mdash;a calico one. But I have this&mdash;this
old buck-skin one. See, it has bead-work
on it. Isn't it pretty?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the girl, as Hope held it
up for inspection. "<i>Isn't</i> it lovely!"</p>

<p>"Very old and dingy-looking, but I'll put
it on and wear it," she decided.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when they had arranged
the small, barren room somewhat more
comfortably, Hope Hathaway, attired in her
dress of Indian make, joined the Harris girls
at their frugal meal. Her dark hair was parted
in the center and hung in two long braids down
her back. That, combined with the beaded
dress, fringed properly, her black eyes, and
quiet expressionless face, made a very picturesque
representation of an Indian girl. Truly
she was one of them. The breed girls must
have thought something of the same, for they
became at their ease, talking very much as
girls talk the world over. There were three of
them between the ages of fourteen and eighteen,
and Hope soon found herself well entertained
and almost contented. The loneliness
soon wore away, and before realizing it she
began to feel at home&mdash;almost one of them,
true to her spirit of adaptability. But yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for her supper she ate only two hard boiled
eggs.</p>

<p>After the meal the breed girls walked with
her down to the spring-house where the milk
and butter was kept. From underneath the
small log building a large spring crept lazily
out, spreading itself as it went into a miniature
lake which lay between the house buildings and
the stables. It was the only thing on the ranch
worthy of notice, and, in a country barren of
water excepting in the form of narrow winding
creeks, it was pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>The men and boys had disappeared, the
younger children were with their mother, and
even the pigs had drowsily gone to their sleeping
quarters. The place seemed strangely
quiet after its recent noise and commotion.</p>

<p>Finally the girls returned to the house to
help with the small children, while in the deepening
twilight Hope remained alone beside the
lake. The water into which she looked and
dreamed was shallow, but the deepening
shadows concealed that fact. To her fancy it
might have been bottomless. Someone rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
up on horseback, but she paid no attention
until a pleasant voice close beside her startled
her from her reverie.</p>

<p>"Can I trouble you for a drink of that
water, please? I have often wished for one
as I rode past; it looks so clear and cold." She
bowed her head in assent, and, bringing a cup
from the spring-house, stooped and filled it for
him. He thanked her and drank the water
eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is good, just as I thought, and cold as
ice," he said; then, noticing the girl more
closely, continued: "I have been talking with
your father over there at the corral, and am returning
home."</p>

<p>"With my <i>father</i>," emphasized the girl.
The young man noted with wonderment the
richness of her voice, the soft, alluring grace
of every movement. Someone had jokingly
told him before he left his old-country home
that he would bring back an Indian wife, as
one of historical fame had done centuries before.
He laughed heartily at the time&mdash;he
smiled now, but thought of it. He thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of it again many times that evening and
cursed himself for such folly. Perhaps there
was Indian medicine in the cup she gave him,
or perhaps he looked an instant too long into
those dark, unfathomable eyes. He found
himself explaining:</p>

<p>"Yes; your father has agreed to sell me that
team I have been wanting. I am coming back
for the horses to-morrow."</p>

<p>"My <i>father</i>," she began again. "Oh, yes,
of course. I thought&mdash;&mdash;Would you like
another drink of the water?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please." It seemed good to
stand there in the growing darkness, and another
drink would give him fully a minute. He
watched her supple figure as she stooped to refill
the tin cup. What perfect physiques some
of these Indian girls possessed! He did not
wonder so much now that some men forgot
their families and names for these dark-skinned
women.</p>

<p>"I am coming to-morrow for the horses&mdash;in
the morning," he repeated foolishly, returning
the cup. She did not speak again, so bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ding
her a courteous good-night he mounted
his horse and rode slowly into the gathering
dusk.</p>

<p>Hope stood there for a moment, returning
to her study of the water; then two of the breed
girls came toward her. One of them was giggling
audibly.</p>

<p>"We heard him," said Mary. "He thought
you was one of us. It'll be fun to fool him.
He's new out here, and don't know much, anyhow.
He's Edward Livingston, an Englishman,
an' has got a sheep ranch about three
miles over there."</p>

<p>"A <i>sheep-man</i>!" exclaimed Hope, "Isn't
that too bad!"</p>

<p>"You hate sheep-men, too?" asked the older
girl.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know that I <i>hate</i> them, but
there's a feeling&mdash;a sort of something one can't
get over, something that grows in the air if
you're raised among cattle. I despise sheep,
detest them. They spoil our cattle range."
Then after a short pause: "It's too bad he
isn't a cattle-man!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I think," said Mary, "because
the men are all gettin' down on him. He runs
his sheep all over their range, an' they're
makin' a big talk."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't tell things, Mary, they're
only talkin', anyway," reproved the older girl.</p>

<p>"<i>Talkin'!</i> Well, I should say so, an' you bet
they mean business! But Miss Hathaway&mdash;Hope&mdash;don't
care, an' I don't care neither, if
he gets into a scrape; only he's got such a nice,
pleasant face, an' he ain't on to the ways out
here yet, neither&mdash;an' I don't care <i>what</i> the
men say! Tain't as if he meant anything
through real meanness."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied the older girl, "but
maybe she don't want to hear such talk. It's
bedtime, anyway; let's go in."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm tired," said Hope wearily, adding
as she bade Mary good-night at her door:
"I do hope he won't get into any trouble."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>The three months' school had begun in
earnest. Each day Hope found new
interest in her small class and in her
surroundings. She readily learned to dispense
with all the comforts and luxuries to
which she had been born, substituting instead
a rare sense of independence, an expansion of
her naturally wild spirit. She dispensed also
with conventionalities, except such as were ingrained
with her nature, yet she was far from
happy in the squaw-man's family. She could
have ridden home in a few hours, but remembered
too keenly her mother's anger and her
father's parting words. He said to her:</p>

<p>"You have hurt your mother and spoiled
her summer by the stand you have taken. You
are leaving here against my wishes and against
your own judgment. The only thing I've got
to say is this: don't come back here till you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
finished your contract up there, till you've
kept your word to the letter. No one of my
blood is going back on their word. A few
rough knocks will do you good."</p>

<p>He probably discovered in a very few hours
how much he loved his girl, how she had grown
into his life, for the next day after she had left
he drove to the distant town and hunted up
his wife's nephew, who had caused all this
trouble.</p>

<p>"You deserve another thrashing," he said
when he had found him, "but now you've got
to turn to and do what you can to bring things
back to where they were. Hope's left home
and 's gone to teaching school up in the mountains
at Harris'. Now, what in thunder am I
going to do about it? She can't live there with
those breeds. Lord, I slept there once and
the fleas nearly ate me up!"</p>

<p>The boy's face turned a trifle pale. "I'm
sorry, uncle, about this. I never thought she
would do such a thing, on my account&mdash;not
after I left. And she's gone to Joe Harris'
place! I know all about that, a regular nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of low breeds and rustlers. She can't stay
there!"</p>

<p>"But she will, just the same," announced the
man, "because when she told me that she'd
promised Harris, and that she was going, anyway,
I told her to go and take her medicine till
the school term was ended."</p>

<p>"But surely you won't allow her to stay, to
<i>live</i> at Joe Harris'! There are other people
up there, white people, with whom she could
live. Why, uncle, you can't allow her to stay
there!"</p>

<p>"Why not? She's made her nest, let her
lie in it for awhile&mdash;fleas and all. It won't
hurt her any. But I'm going to keep a close
eye on her just the same. I couldn't go up
there myself on account of your aunt's being
here, but I was thinking about it all last night,
and I finally concluded to send a bunch of cattle
up there, beef cattle, and hold 'em for shipment.
Now I came here to town to tell you
that your aunt wants you to come back to the
ranch, but you're not going to come back, see?
You're going up there and hold those cattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
for a spell, and keep your eye on my girl. I
don't give a damn about the steers&mdash;it's the
girl; but you've got to have an excuse for being
there. Your aunt's got to have an excuse,
too. These cattle&mdash;there's two hundred head
of 'em&mdash;they're <i>yours</i>&mdash;see? I'll have 'em all
vented to-morrow, for in case Hope thought
they wasn't yours she might catch on. You
can ship 'em in the fall for your trouble. She
won't think anything of you holding cattle up
there, because the range is so good. So you
look out for her, see how she is every day, and
send me word by McCullen, who I'll send
along with you. You can take a cook and
another man if you need one. And now don't
let her catch on that I had a hand in this! Seen
anything of them blame New Yorkers yet?"
Young Carter shook his head absent-mindedly.
He was filled with delight at this clever
scheme of his uncle's. "No? Well, mebbe
there's a telegram. Your aunt expected me
to take them back to the ranch to-morrow.
Never mind thanking me for the cattle. You
do your part to the letter. Send me word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
every day and don't forget. And another
thing, just quit your thinking about marrying
that girl, and keep your hands off of her!
Remember she's in a wild country up there,
among tough customers, and she probably
knows it by now, and the <i>chances are</i> she's got
a gun buckled onto her!"</p>

<p>He was right. Hope found herself among
too many rough characters to feel safe without
a gun concealed beneath her blouse or
jacket, yet rough as the men were, they treated
this quiet-faced girl with the utmost respect,
perhaps fearing her. Her reputation as a
phenomenal shot was not far-fetched, and had
reached the remotest corners of the country.
She had played with a gun as a baby, had been
allowed to use one when a wee child, and had
grown up with the passion for firearms strong
within her. Shooting was a gift with her,
perfected by daily practice. In one of her
rooms at the ranch the girl had such a collection
of firearms as would have filled the heart
of many an old connoisseur with longing. It
was her one passion, perhaps not a more ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>pensive
one than most women possess; yet, for
a girl, unique. Her father gratified her in
this, just as other fathers gratify their girls in
their desire for music, art, fine clothes, or all,
as the case may be. But the things that most
girls love so well had small place in the life of
Hope Hathaway. She cared little for music,
and less for fine clothes. Society she detested,
declaring that a full season in New York
would kill her. Perhaps if she had not been
filled with the determination to stay away from
it, its excitement might finally have won her;
but she was of the West. Its vastness filled her
with a love that was part of her nature. Its
boundless prairies, its freedom, were greater
than all civilization had to offer her.</p>

<p>She brought with her to the mountains a
long-distance rifle and a brace of six-shooters.
A shotgun she seldom used, for the reason that
to her quick, accurate eye a rifle did better,
more varied work, and answered every purpose
of a shotgun. It was said that each bird she
marked on the wing dropped at her feet in two
pieces, its head severed smoothly. This may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
not have been true always, but the fact remains
that the birds dropped when she touched
the trigger.</p>

<p>She was an odd character for a girl, reserved
and quiet even with her most intimate friends,
rough and impulsive as a boy sometimes, in
speech and actions, again as dignified as the
proudest queen. Her friends never knew how
to take her, because they never understood her.
She left, so far along her trail in life, nothing
but shattered ideals and delusions, but she had
not become cynical or embittered, only wiser.
After her first week's stay at Harris' she began
to realize that perhaps she had always expected
too much of people. Here were people of
whom she had expected nothing opening up
new side lights on life that she had never
thought to explore. Life seemed full of possibilities
to her now, at least, immediate possibilities.</p>

<p>She had not met again the courteous,
smooth-faced young man who had mistaken
her for an Indian girl, though he had come the
next morning for the horses, and had ridden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
past the ranch more than once. Yet she had
not forgotten the incident, or what the Harris
girls had told her, for daily as she passed the
group of loungers on her return from school
she heard his name gruffly spoken, intermixed
with oaths. They certainly meant mischief,
and she was curious to know what it was.</p>

<p>The first school week had ended. On Friday
night she wondered how she could manage to
exist through Saturday and Sunday, but Saturday
morning found her in the saddle, accompanied
by the three largest Harris boys, en
route for the highest peaks of the mountains.</p>

<p>"This is something like living," she exclaimed,
pulling in her horse after the first few
miles. "How pretty all of this is! What
people call scenery, I suppose. But give me
the prairie, smooth and level as far as the eye
can reach! There's nothing like it in all the
world! The open prairie, a cool, spring day
like this, and a horse that will go till it's ready
to fall dead&mdash;that is life! Who is it that lives
over there?" she asked, pointing toward some
ranch buildings, nestled in a low, green valley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the Englishman's place," answered
the soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"Sheep-man," explained Dave disgustedly.
"See them sheds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the new man by the name of Livingston.
Do you boys know him?" asked the girl
curiously.</p>

<p>"Nope! Don't want to, neither. Seen him
lots of times, though," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"He's come in here without bein' asked, an'
thinks he can run the whole country," explained
the soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"Is he trying to run the whole country?"
asked Hope.</p>

<p>"Well, he's runnin' his sheep over everybody's
range, an' they ain't goin' to stand for
it," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"But what can they do about it? Have they
asked him to move his sheep?"</p>

<p>"No. What's the use after they've been over
the range&mdash;spoiled it, anyhow. No, you bet
they ain't goin' to ask him nothing!"</p>

<p>The girl thought for a moment, absently
pulling the "witches' knots" from her horse's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mane, while it climbed a hill at a swinging
gait, then continued as though talking to
herself:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time a young man took what
money he had in the world, and going into a
far-away, wild country started in business for
himself. He had heard, probably, that there
was more money in sheep than in cattle. A
great many people do hear that, so he bought
sheep, thinking, perhaps, to make a pile of
money in a few years, and then go back to his
home and marry some nice, good girl of his
choice. It takes money to get married and
make a home, and to do mostly anything, they
say, and so this young man bought sheep, for
no one goes into the sheep business or any other
kind of business unless they want to make
money. They don't generally do it for fun.
And, of course, he thought, as they all do, to
get rich immediately. He made a great mistake
in the beginning, being extremely ignorant.
He brought his sheep to a cattle country,
where there were no other sheep near his own.
All the men around him hated sheep, as men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
who own cattle always do, and hating the
sheep, they thought they hated the sheep-man
also, who really was a very harmless young
man, and wouldn't have offended them for
anything. But these men's dislike for the
sheep grew daily, and so their fancied dislike
for the young man grew in proportion.</p>

<p>"The men in the country would meet together
in little groups, and every day some
man would have some new grievance to tell
the others. It finally got on their brains,
until all they could think or talk about was this
new man and his sheep. The more they
thought and talked, the more angry they became,
until finally they forgot that he was another
man like themselves&mdash;in all likelihood a
good, honest man, who would not have done
them wrong knowingly. They forgot a great
many things, and all they could think about
night or day was how they could do something
to injure his business or himself. They got so
after awhile that they talked only in low
whispers about him, taking great pains that
their families, children, and even their big <i>boys</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
should not know their plans. They made a
great mistake in not taking their boys into
their confidence, because <i>boys</i> are very often
more reliable than men, and can always keep
a secret a whole lot better. But perhaps the
fathers knew that the boys had very good sense
and would not go into anything like that without
a better reason than they had, which was no
reason at all.</p>

<p>"I never heard just what they planned to do
to this newcomer to get rid of him and his
sheep, but I know how it had to end." She
looked up, searching each boy's intent, astonished
face.</p>

<p>"Say, what're you drivin' at, anyway? You
can't fool me&mdash;it's <i>him</i>!" exclaimed Dave,
pointing toward the sheep-ranch. "You're
makin' up a story about him!"</p>

<p>"How'd you know all that?" asked the
quicker, soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"Know all that. Why, how did you boys
know all that? I suppose that I have ears,
too&mdash;and I've heard of such things before,"
she replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you don't know how the end'll be.
That's one thing you don't know," declared the
soft-voiced twin. "You can't know that."</p>

<p>"She might be a fortune-teller like grandmother
White Blanket," laughed the other.</p>

<p>"Is that old squaw in the farthest tepee
from the house your own grandmother?"
asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Yep, an' she ain't no squaw, either! She's
a French half-breed," he said, with an unconscious
proud uplifting of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Hope laughed slightly. "What's the other
half?" she asked. The boy gave her a look of
deep commiseration.</p>

<p>"I thought you had more learnin' than that!
Why, the other half's white, of course."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" gasped the girl. "My
education along those lines must have been
somewhat neglected. I had an idea that those
were Indians camped down at your place. But
French half-breeds,&mdash;a mixture of <i>white</i> and
<i>French</i>,&mdash;that's a different matter!" She
stopped her horse and laughed with the immoderation
of a boy. "That is rich," she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
"If ever I go to New York again I shall
spring that on the Prince. '<i>Mon Dieu!</i>' he will
exclaim. 'What then are we, Mademoiselle,
<i>we</i>, the <i>aristocracy</i>&mdash;the great nation of the
<i>French</i>?'" Her face sobered. "But this is
not the question. <i>I</i> do know how this will end,
and I am not a fortune-teller, either. I know
that the ones who are in the wrong about this
matter will get the worst of it. Sometimes it
means states prison, sometimes death&mdash;at all
events, something not expected. I tell you,
boys, I wouldn't want to be on the wrong side
of this for anything! And do you know, I
am real glad that your father doesn't need
your help. We will take a little side of our
own and watch things&mdash;what do you say? It
will be lots of fun, and we'll know all the time
that we are in the right, and maybe we can
prevent them from doing any real wrong to
themselves." She watched them closely to see
how they accepted the suggestion. Her inspiration
might be considered a reckless one,
but their young minds lent themselves readily
to her influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old man licked me this mornin',"
growled Dave. "An' he can go straight to the
hot place now, for all o' me! I'm goin' off on
the round-up, anyway, next year."</p>

<p>"You boys know, don't you, that if your
father ever found out that <i>I</i> knew anything
about this thing, he would probably give me a
licking, too&mdash;and send me out of the country?"
This for effect.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see him lay hands on you,"
roared Dave. "I'd fill him so full of lead that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words failed him.</p>

<p>"I'd kill him if he did, Miss Hathaway,"
exclaimed the small boy, Ned, with quiet assurance
that brought a hint of laughter to the
girl's face. The soft-voiced twin rode up very
close to her.</p>

<p>"He ain't goin' to find it out, an' don't you
worry; we'll all stand by you while there's one
of us left!"</p>

<p>"All right, boys, we're comrades now. I'll
tell you what we'll do; we'll form a band&mdash;brigade&mdash;all
by ourselves. I am commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
officer and you are my faithful scouts. How's
that?" Hope's fancy was leading her away.
"Come on," she cried, "let's race this flat!"</p>

<p>The self-appointed commanding officer
reached the smooth valley far in advance of her
faithful scouts, who yelled in true Indian
fashion as they rode up with her.</p>

<p>"I'll run you a mile an' beat you all hollow,"
declared Dave. "But on a two hundred yard
stretch like this here place my horse don't have
no chance to get started."</p>

<p>"I'll bet my quirt against yourn that you
lose," said the soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"Keep your quirt! I don't want it, nohow.
One's enough fur me. But I <i>can</i> beat her just
the same!" Dave was stubbornly positive.</p>

<p>"You'll have to ride my horse if you do beat
her," continued the soft-voiced twin. Dave
grew furious.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, that raw-boned, loose-jointed,
watch-eyed cayuse o' yourn couldn't
run a good half mile without fallin' dead in his
tracks! What'er you a-givin' me, anyhow?"
At that instant his attention was fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
taken. "Where'd all them cattle come from?"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They had turned up a narrow gulch, the
youngest boy and Hope taking the lead, and
had traveled it for perhaps fifty yards when
they found themselves at a stand-still before a
drove of cattle that were making their way
slowly down the narrow trail.</p>

<p>"We won't go back," called the girl. "Come
on up here and wait till they pass." And
followed by the boys she guided her horse up
the steep, rocky side of a high bank, and waited
while the cattle came slowly on. They counted
them as they passed in twos and threes down
the narrow valley. When nearly two hundred
had gone by a rider came in sight around the
bend of the hill. Hope's horse whinnied, and
the man's answered back, then the girl gave
a scream of delight, and, unmindful of the
rocky bank, or of the appearance of two other
riders, rushed down, nearly unseating the
old cow-puncher in her demonstrations of
welcome.</p>

<p>"<i>Jim! Dear old Jim! Where</i> did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
come from? I am so glad to see you! Why,
Jim, I'd rather see you than anyone in the
world! How glad I am! Boys," she called,
"come down here. This is Jim, my dear old
father Jim!" Old Jim McCullen's eyes were
dimmed with tears as he looked from the girl's
happy, flushed face to the last of the cattle that
were going out of sight around the bend of the
gulch. "Where did you come from, Jim, and
what brings you up here? Whose cattle?
Why, they're ours, and rebranded! What are
you doing with them?" Just then the two
riders, whom in her excitement she had failed
to notice, rode up. "Why, Syd, hello," she
said. "And you're here, too! I thought Jim
was alone."</p>

<p>She changed instantly from her glad excitement,
speaking with the careless abruptness of
a boy. Her cousin rode alongside. She gave
one glance at his companion, then wheeled her
horse about and stationed herself a short distance
away beside the breed boys.</p>

<p>"This is a happy surprise, Hope," exclaimed
her cousin. "What are you doing up here so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
far away from home?" She regarded him a
trifle more friendly.</p>

<p>"Is it possible you don't know? Didn't
you tell him, Jim, that I had gone away? Oh,
I forgot, you weren't at the ranch when I left,
so you couldn't tell him. Well, I am here, as
you can see, Sydney&mdash;partly because I wanted
a change, partly because they wanted a
school-teacher up here. I am staying at Joe
Harris'. What are you doing here with those
cattle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thought I'd go to work for a change.
Just some cattle that I bought to hold for fall
shipment." He turned to the man at his side,
apologizing, then proceeded to introduce him
to his cousin. The girl cut it short by a peculiar
brief nod.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've met Mr. Livingston before!"</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Carter in surprise, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"At Harris'" explained the sheep-man.
"She gave me one of the sweetest, most refreshing
drinks of water it has ever been my
privilege to enjoy." He spoke easily, yet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
much perturbed. Here was his shy Indian
maid, a remarkably prepossessed, up-to-date
young woman. It took a little time to get it
straightened out in his mind.</p>

<p>"Of course I might have known that you
two would have met. There are so few people
here." Carter tried to speak indifferently.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by," said the girl, moving
away.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry! Where are you going,
Hope?" called her cousin.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but can't wait any longer. We're
off for a day's exploring. Good-by."</p>

<p>"I'll see you this evening. We're going to
camp near Harris'," said Carter.</p>

<p>"No, not this evening," she called back to
him as she rode on up the gulch. "I won't be
back till late, and then I'll be too tired to see
anyone. Good-by, Jim&mdash;I'll see <i>you</i> to-morrow."
Old Jim watched her until she was lost
to sight in the turn of the gulch. Livingston
also watched her until she was out of sight.
She rode astride, wearing a neat divided skirt,
and sat her horse with all the ease and perfec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>tion
of a young cowboy. Old Jim McCullen
went on in trail of the cattle, while young Carter
and Livingston followed leisurely.</p>

<p>"Rather a cool greeting from a girl one
expects to marry," said Carter, under his
breath.</p>

<p>"Is it possible&mdash;your fiancée!" Livingston's
face became thoughtful. "You are to
be congratulated," he said.</p>

<p>Carter laughed nervously. "I can scarcely
say she is <i>that</i>, yet&mdash;but it is her mother's wish.
We have grown up together. Miss Hathaway
is my cousin, my second cousin. I can
see no reason why we will not be married&mdash;some
time."</p>

<p>"<i>Miss Hathaway</i>," mused his companion.
"And you love her?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Carter, wondering at
the other's abrupt way of speaking.</p>

<p>"And may I ask if she loves you?" The
sheep-man's tone was quiet and friendly. Carter
wished that it might have been insolent.
As it was he could only laugh uneasily.</p>

<p>"It would seem not," he answered. "To-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>day
she is like an icicle&mdash;to-morrow she will be
a most devoted girl. That is Hope&mdash;as
changeable as the wind. One never knows
what to expect. One day loving&mdash;the next,
cold and indifferent. But then, you see, I am
used to her little ways."</p>

<p>"I wish you all the happiness you deserve,
Mr. Carter," said Livingston a little later, as
he rode off, taking a short cut to his ranch.</p>

<p>"<i>Hope</i>&mdash;<i>Hope Hathaway</i>; Carter's cousin.
What an idiot I've been to think of her
as an Indian girl! An odd name&mdash;Hope.
<i>Hope Hath a way</i>," he mused as he rode homeward.
"If only I had the right to hope!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>"I wish there was a shorter cut to get
home," said the girl wearily. "I'm just
about tired. Climbing mountains is a
little out of my line. I wonder how long it will
take to get used to it."</p>

<p>"There is a shorter way, Miss Hathaway,"
said one of the breed boys. "It's through that
sheep-ranch there. We always used to go that
way before they fenced it in, but there's gates
to it if we can find 'em."</p>

<p>"Let's go through that way, then, if it's
shorter. Of course it is shorter&mdash;I can see
that, and we'll trust to luck to be able to see the
gates. I suppose they're wire gates."</p>

<p>"Yes, just regular wire gates, an' it's gettin'
dark pretty blame fast, but mebbe we can find
'em all right."</p>

<p>So they followed the fence, searching in the
dim light for the almost invisible gate&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
girl who had that day appointed herself commanding
officer and her three brave scouts.</p>

<p>Alongside the wire fence they followed a
narrow cow-trail for nearly a quarter of a mile,
then the path disappeared inside the field, and
the side-hills along which they were obliged to
travel were rough and dangerous. It was late,
and darkness settled down around them, cutting
from their vision everything but a small
line of fence and the nearby hills.</p>

<p>They made slow headway over the rocky
banks. Hope, tired with the day's exploring
and hungry after her long ride and the somewhat
slender diet of the past week, was sorry
they had not gone the road, which, though
longer, would not have taken such a length of
time to travel. The boys were good scouts,
yet it became evident that they had never followed
the new line of fence before. Their
horses slipped upon the sides of steep inclines
which became more rocky and dangerous as
they proceeded. Darkness increased rapidly.
One horse in the rear fell down, but the rider
was upon his feet in an instant; then they dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>mounted
and led their horses, traveling along
very slowly in Indian file. Some time later
they found the wire gate, much to the girl's
relief. It was then quite dark. The moon
had risen, but showed itself fitfully behind
black, stormy looking clouds. Without difficulty
they discovered a trail leading somewhere,
and followed it until they rounded a
point from which they could see the light in
the sheep-man's house.</p>

<p>"Why, we're almost up to his <i>house</i>!" exclaimed
Hope. "This isn't the way. We
don't want to go there!"</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll have to get pretty close up to
it to find the road that goes to the other gate,"
said the soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"How foolish we've been," sighed the girl.</p>

<p>"Yep, a pack o' idiots," agreed Dave.</p>

<p>"But it's too dark for anyone to see us&mdash;or
notice us," she said with relief. "I think we
might go right up to the house and look
through the windows without anyone seeing
us."</p>

<p>"Let's do it," suggested Dave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well I should say not!" exclaimed the girl.
"It's the last thing on earth I would do&mdash;<i>peek</i>
into anyone's window! I am not so curious to
see the interior of <i>his</i> house&mdash;or anyone's else."</p>

<p>"I'll bet they're just eatin' supper," said
Ned hungrily.</p>

<p>"All the better," replied Hope; "there will
be no one around to see us then. I wonder
how much closer we'll have to go?"</p>

<p>"Not much further," answered the soft-voiced
twin wisely. "See, there's the barns,
an' the road ain't a great ways off." He led
the way, while Hope and the boy, Dave, followed
close, and the youngest boy trailed along
somewhere in the rear. They passed between
the stables and the house, then, aided by the fitful
moon, found the road, along which they
made better time.</p>

<p>Hope felt a great relief as they began to
leave the house in the distance, though why,
she could scarcely have explained. She said to
herself that she was in a hurry to reach home,
but as they neared the huge, flat-roofed sheep-sheds
she slowed up her horse, which had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
on ahead of the others, and glanced back at
her approaching scouts. The twins came up
with her, then she stopped and looked behind.</p>

<p>"Where's Ned?" she asked sharply, a sudden
suspicion entering her head. "What's
keeping him?"</p>

<p>"He went up to the house to see what's
goin' on," replied Dave. "I saw him start for
that way."</p>

<p>"How dared he do it! He will be seen and
then what will they think! We will wait for
him here." Then angrily to the boy: "If
you knew he was going to do that Indian trick
why didn't you stop him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know nothin' till I missed him,"
replied the boy.</p>

<p>"No, we didn't know he was goin', but when
we saw he was gone for sure it wouldn't 'a' done
no good to 'a' gone after him. Anyway, we
wouldn't 'a' left <i>you</i> alone!" The soft-voiced
twin was a genius at finding explanations. He
was never at a loss.</p>

<p>The girl recovered her temper instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"You did quite right, my brave scout," she
cried. "I see you have learned the first and
greatest principle of your vocation. <i>Never
desert a lady, no matter what danger she may be
in.</i> But what a temptation it must have been
to you to follow him and bring him back to
me!" There is no doubt but that the sarcasm
was wasted upon the breed boys, who waited
stolidly with her near some sheltering brush
for the truant Ned, whose mischievousness had
led him off the trail.</p>

<p>At last he rode up with them, surprised out
of breath to find them there waiting for him.
The girl took him by the sleeve. "You're a
bad boy. Next time ask me when you have an
inclination to do anything like that. Now
give an account of yourself. What did you
see?"</p>

<p>"I just wanted to see what they had to eat,
so I peeked in," apologized the youngster.
"There was two men eatin' their supper. The
boss wasn't there. I heard old Morris tell another
fellow that he was out helpin' put in the
sheep."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"But here are the sheds, and surely there are
no sheep here," she exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p>"They're keepin' 'em in the open corrals
down the road a piece," explained the soft-voiced
twin. "They don't keep no sheep here
in the sheds now."</p>

<p>The commanding officer breathed easier.
"That's good; come on then," she said, riding
ahead. They had not proceeded fifty yards
when the low tones of men's voices reached
them. Simultaneously they stopped their
horses and listened, but nothing save an indistinct
murmur could be heard. One of the
twins slipped from his horse and handed the
bridle reins to the girl, then crept forward. In
the darkness she could not tell which one it was,
nor did she care. She was filled with excitement
and the longing for adventure which the
time and place aggravated. Had they not
that day formed a band of secrecy&mdash;she and
her three brave scouts? It occurred to her that
it might be the sheep-man returning with a
herder, but if so he had no right to stand at
such a distance and talk in guarded tones. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
very atmosphere of the place felt suspicious.
They drew their horses to one side of the roadway,
waiting in absolute silence for the return
of the scout. The voices reached them occasionally
from the opposite side of a clump of
brush not a stone's throw away.</p>

<p>They waited several minutes, which seemed
interminable, then a dark form appeared and
a voice whispered softly: "Somethin's up!
Let's get the horses over by the fence so's they
can't hear us." The twin led the way, taking
a wide circuit about the spot from where the
sound of voices came. They reached the fence
quickly without noise, securing their horses
behind a screen of scrubby willows.</p>

<p>"Now, go on," said the girl. "What did
you hear?"</p>

<p>"When I crawled up close I saw two men.
One of 'em said, 'Shut up. You're makin'
too much noise! Do you want 'em to hear
you up to the house?' The other said he didn't
give a damn, that they might just as well make
a good job of it an' kill off Livingston while
they were getting rid of his sheep. These two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fellers have just come over to guard the road
from the house to keep the men there from
interferin', but the mob's down there at the
corral waitin' to do the work. I found that
much out an' then I sneaked back. I reckon
they're goin' to drive the sheep over the cut-bank."</p>

<p>"The devils!" cried Hope, under her breath.
"They're going to pile up the sheep and kill
him if he interferes, are they? <i>We'll show
them!</i>"</p>

<p>"We can't do anything," said the boy.
"There's more'n a dozen men out there at the
corrals, an' it's darker'n pitch."</p>

<p>"So we'll just have to stand here and see
that crime committed!" she burst out. "No,
not on your life! You boys have got to stand
by me. Surely you're just as brave as a girl?
We're going over there where we can see what's
going on, and the first man that tries to drive
a sheep out of that corral gets one of these!"
She patted the barrel of her rifle as she pulled
it from its saddle case. "Get your guns and
come along." But they were not far behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
her in getting their weapons. The older boys
had revolvers, and little Ned was armed with
a Winchester repeating shotgun.</p>

<p>The twins were never seen without their
guns, and had the reputation of sleeping with
them at night. For wildness those two boys
were the terror of the country. Their hearts
sang a heathenish song of joy at this new adventure.
Surely they were as brave as a girl!
Her taunt rankled some. They would show
her that they were not cowards! She had begun
to worry already!</p>

<p>"Oh, what if it should be too late! What if
we should be too late! Oh, it can't be! Let's
go faster!" she cried.</p>

<p>The breed boys crept along close to the
ground, making altogether much less noise
than the girl, who seemed to think that speed
and action were all that was necessary.</p>

<p>"Sh! Keep quieter. You musn't let them
know anyone's 'round. Those fellers by the
road 're just over there, an' they'll hear us,"
whispered Dan.</p>

<p>Then slower, more stealthily, they crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
around the two men who guarded the road, and
with less caution approached the corrals, the
girl meanwhile recovering her composure to a
great degree, though her heart still beat wildly.
The night seemed a trifle lighter now to her
straining eyes. What if the moon should
come out, revealing them to the men waiting
beyond the corrals? She grasped her rifle
firmly, and her heart beat quicker at the
thought. The soft-voiced twin must have felt
the same fear, for he came close and whispered
in her ear: "The corrals ain't more'n a rod,
right over there. We'd better make a run for
that bush there on this side of it, for the moon's
comin' out&mdash;see!" He pointed upward. A
rift had come in the black cloud from which the
moon shone dimly, growing momentarily
brighter. Before them the corral loomed up
like a great flat patch of darkness, and to one
side of this dark patch something taller stood
in dim relief&mdash;a small clump of brush, toward
which the odd little scouting party ran in all
haste. Safe within its shelter, a fierce joy,
savage in its intensity, filled the girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, Moon, come on in all your
glory!" she whispered; then, as if in answer to
her command, it came in full splendor from
behind its veil of black. It might have been a
signal. Back in the hills a coyote called weirdly
to its mate, but before the last wailing note had
died away a sharp report sounded on the still
air, followed by the groans of a man in mortal
agony. Hope, upon her knees in the brush,
clasped her hands to her throat to stifle a
cry.</p>

<p>"Now drive his damn'd sheep into the
gulch!" commanded a gruff voice.</p>

<p>Following the pain, a fierce light came into
the girl's eyes. Over tightly closed teeth her
lips parted dryly. Instinctively the breed
boys crept behind her, leaving her upon one
knee before the heap of brush. A man leaped
into the corral among the stupid sheep, and as
he leaped a bullet passed through his hand.</p>

<p>"God, I'm killed!" he cried, as he sank
limply out of sight among the sheep. For a
few moments not a sound came except the occasional
bleating of a lamb, then the gate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the corral, which was ajar, opened as by some
invisible hand, and the great body of animals
crowded slowly toward the entrance.</p>

<p>"They think there's only one man here, and
they're not going to be bluffed by one," whispered
Hope. "See, they must be coaxing the
leaders with hay, and there's something going
on back there that will make them stampede
in a moment, and then the cut-bank! But
we'll bluff them; make them think there's a
whole regiment here. There's four of us.
Now get your guns ready. Good; now when I
start, all of you shoot at once as fast as you can
load. Aim high in that direction. Shoot in
the air, not <i>anywhere</i> else. Now do as I tell
you. Now, all together!" For two or three
minutes those four guns made music. The
hills gathered up the noise and flung it back,
making the air ring with a deafening sound.
"Shoot up! Shoot higher, or you'll be hitting
someone," she admonished, as dark forms began
to rise from the ground beyond the corral
and run away.</p>

<p>"They're crawling away like whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
dogs," exclaimed a twin in glee. "I'd like to
shoot one for luck!"</p>

<p>"Shame on you," cried the girl softly.
"That would be downright murder while
they're running."</p>

<p>"I reckon there's been murder already to-night,"
said the soft-voiced twin. Hope turned
upon him fiercely: "That wasn't murder! I
shot him through the hand. Murder? Do you
call it murder to kill one of those beasts? You
mean&mdash;you mean that they killed <i>him</i>! I forgot
for a minute! Oh, it couldn't be that they
killed <i>him</i>&mdash;Mr. Livingston! Are you sure he
wasn't up at the house, Ned? I must find out."
She started toward the corral. Dave pulled
her back roughly.</p>

<p>"See there! Those fellers that was on guard
down there 're comin' back. They must have
left their horses down by that rock. They'll
ketch us sure!" She drew back into the brush
again, waiting until the two men, whose voices
first brought suspicion to their minds, had
passed by, skirting the corral in diplomatic
manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Hope, who had been so eager to search the
scene of bloodshed, crept from the brush and
took the opposite direction, followed closely by
the breed boys. When they reached their
horses she spoke:</p>

<p>"Now you boys go home. Go in from the
back coulee and sneak into bed. Don't let
anyone see you, whatever you do, for if this
was ever found out&mdash;&mdash;" She waited for their
imaginations to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"We can sneak in all right," exclaimed
Dave. "We know how to do that! They'll
never find it out in ten years!"</p>

<p>"Then go at once. Ride fast by the Spring
coulee and get there ahead of the men&mdash;if there
should be any that belong there. I will come
later. If they ask, say that I'm in bed, or taking
a walk, or anything that comes into your
head. But you won't be questioned. You
mustn't be! Now hurry up!"</p>

<p>"But why won't you come along with us?"
asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Because if we should be caught together
they would know who did the shooting. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
they see you alone they will not suspect you,
and if they see me alone they will never think
of such a thing. It is the wisest way, besides
I have other reasons. Now don't stand there
all night talking to me, but go, unless you want
to make trouble." She watched them until
they were lost to sight, then mounted her horse
and rode back over the road that she had come,
straight up to the sheep-man's house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>It was fully half a mile to Livingston's
house. The trail showed plainly in the
moonlight, winding in ghostly fashion
through thick underbrush, and crossed in several
places by a small mountain stream through
which the horse plunged, splashing the girl
plentifully. She had an impression that she
ought to go back to the corral and discover just
what mischief had been done, but shivered at
the thought of hunting for dead men in the
darkness. A feeling of weird uneasiness crept
over her. She wished that she had brought
the breed boys with her, though realizing that
the proper thing had been done in sending
them home in order that their secret might be
safe, and so prevent more evil. She knew that
she would find men at the house who could
take lanterns and go to the scene of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
trouble. The past half hour seemed remote
and unreal, yet the picture of it passed
through her brain again and again before she
reached the house. She could hear the first
shot, so startling and unexpected, and the man's
terrible groans rang in her ears until she cried
out as if to drive them from her. Was he
dead? she wondered. Perhaps he lay there
wounded and helpless! Was it Livingston?
If it should be! She thought that she should be
there, groping over the bloody ground for
him. She shook as with a chill. How helpless
she was, after all&mdash;a veritable coward, for
she must go on to the house for assistance!</p>

<p>She slipped from her horse at some distance,
and walked toward the ray of light that came
from a side window. Her knees were weak,
she felt faint and wearied. At the house her
courage failed, she sank limply beside the window,
and looked into the lighted room beyond.
He was not there! One man was reading a
newspaper while another sat on an end of the
table playing a mouth harp.</p>

<p>In her mind she could see the body of Liv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ingston
in the corral, trampled upon and mangled
by a multitude of frightened sheep. She
stifled a cry of horror. Why had she not
gone there at once? For no reason except the
hope in her heart that it might not have been
him who had been shot&mdash;that she might find
him at the house. But he was not there! Then
it must have been he; his groans she had
heard&mdash;that still sounded in her ears. He had
brown hair that waved softly from a brow
broad and white. His face was boyish and
sad in repose. She could see it now as she had
seen it by the spring, and his eyes were gray
and tender. She had noticed them this day.
What was she doing there by the window?
Perhaps after all he was not dead, but suffering
terribly while she lingered!</p>

<p>She rose quickly with new courage. As she
turned a hand touched her on the shoulder,
and she fell back weak against the house.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon! I did not know&mdash;could
scarcely believe that it was you&mdash;Miss&mdash;Hathaway!
Won't you come into the
house?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" she cried as in a dream. "<i>Where</i>
have you been?"</p>

<p>His tone, quiet, polite, hid the surprise that
her question caused.</p>

<p>"I've been back there in the hills hunting
chickens. You see I have been fortunate
enough to get some. I followed them a great
distance, and night overtook me up there so
suddenly that I've had some difficulty in finding
my way back. Now may I ask to what I
owe the honor of this&mdash;visit?"</p>

<p>All fear and weakness had gone. She
stood erect before him, her head thrown back
from her shoulders, her position, as it must
appear to him, driving all else from her
mind.</p>

<p>"In other words, you want to know why I
was peeking into your window at this time of
the day!"</p>

<p>"Just so, if you put it that way. At least
I should be pleased to know the nature of
your visit." He threw the prairie chickens
down beside the house, watching meanwhile
the girl's erect figure. The soft, quiet grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
he had seen at the spring had given place to
something different&mdash;greater.</p>

<p>"Not a very dignified position in which to
be caught&mdash;and I do not like you any better
for having caught me so!" she finally flashed
back at him. "I have no apologies to offer
you, and wouldn't offer one, anyway&mdash;under
the circumstances. I'll tell you what brought
me here, though. While passing by your corral,
down the road, I heard a great commotion,
and some shooting, so I came over here to tell
you. Perhaps I was afraid to pass the corral
after that." She smiled wickedly, but he, innocently
believing, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why were you alone? Where were the
boys that I saw with you this morning? It
isn't right that you should be out alone after
night like this."</p>

<p>"They went on&mdash;ahead of me. I rode
slowly," she replied hesitatingly. He did not
notice her nervous manner of speech.</p>

<p>"They ought to have stayed with you," he
declared. "You should never ride alone, particularly
after dark. Don't do it again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the shooting," she interrupted. "I
came to tell you about it. Someone may have
been hurt."</p>

<p>"It was kind of you to come. There may
be trouble of some sort. I heard shooting, too,
but thought it must be down at Harris'. There
is very often a commotion down there, and
sometimes the air carries sound very clearly.
You are sure it was at the corrals?"</p>

<p>She became impatient. "Positively! I
not only heard the shots plainly, but saw men
ride away. Please lose no more time, but get
your men and a lantern, and come on. There's
evidently been trouble down there, Mr. Livingston,
and your herder may have been hurt.
They are not all good people in these mountains,
by any means."</p>

<p>"Is that so? I had not discovered it. Probably
some of them thought they would like
mutton for their Sunday dinner. It seemed
to me there was considerable firing, though.
You are perfectly sure it was at the corrals?"</p>

<p>"That was my impression, Mr. Livingston,"
she replied briefly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>His face suddenly became anxious. "They
may have hurt Fritz. If anything has happened
to that boy there will be something to
pay! But unless something occurred to delay
the sheep they should have been put in
before dark. I will go at once. Will you
come in the house and stay until my return?
It might not be safe for a lady down there."</p>

<p>"No!" Then, less fiercely: "Have your
men bring their guns and hurry up! I'm going
along with you;" adding: "It's on my
way back."</p>

<p>She waited outside while Livingston informed
his men, who secured rifles, and started
at once for the corrals; then leading her horse
she walked on ahead with him, followed closely
by the two men, who carried lanterns, which
they decided not to light until they reached
the sheep.</p>

<p>Hope never could define her feelings when
she found Livingston safe and unhurt, though
she made a careless attempt at doing so that
night, and afterwards. She walked beside
him in absolute silence. They were going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
see if the herder had been injured in any way.
She knew that he was not only hurt, but in all
likelihood fatally so. His groans rang continually
in her ears, yet it brought her not the
least pain, only a horror, such as she had experienced
when it happened. It was a relief
to her that it had not been Livingston. She
felt sorry, naturally, that a man had been
shot, but what did it matter to her&mdash;one man
more or less? She had never known him.</p>

<p>When they reached the sheep-corrals the
moon still shone brightly, and Hope was filled
with a new fear lest some of the ruffians had
remained behind, and would pick off Livingston.
After the lanterns were lighted she felt
still more nervous for his safety, and could not
restrain her foolish concern until she had
mounted her horse, and made a complete circuit
of the corrals, riding into every patch of
brush about; then only did this fear, which was
such a stranger to her, depart. She rode in
haste back to the corrals, satisfied that the men
had all left, probably badly frightened.</p>

<p>To one side of the paneled enclosure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
men held their lanterns over an inert figure
stretched upon the ground. Livingston was
kneeling beside it. The girl got down from
her horse, and came near them.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead</i>&mdash;yes! The poor boy! May God
have mercy on the brute who committed this
crime! It is terrible&mdash;<i>terrible!</i> Poor faithful
Fritz! Scarcely more than a boy, yet
possessing a man's courage and a man's
heart!" He looked up at the girl's face, and
was amazed at her indifference. Then he
spoke to the men: "Go back and get a wagon
and my saddle horse. I will stay here until
you return. Leave one of the lanterns."</p>

<p>They hurried away, while the man continued
to kneel by the side of the dead herder. Hope
watched him, wondering at his depth of feeling.
Finally she asked: "Was he some relative
of yours?"</p>

<p>"No, only one of my herders&mdash;Fritz, a
bright, good German boy. Why did you
ask, Miss Hathaway?"</p>

<p>"I thought because you cared so much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>&mdash;seemed
to feel so badly,&mdash;that he must be very
near to you."</p>

<p>"He is near to me," he replied, "only as all
children of earth should be near to one another.
Are you not also pained at this sight&mdash;this
boy, in the very beginning of his manhood,
lying here dead?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>pained</i>&mdash;I can't truthfully say that I
am pained&mdash;or care much in that way. He is
dead, so what is the use of caring or worrying
about it. That cannot bring him back to life
again. Of course I would rather he had
lived&mdash;that this had never happened, yet I do
not feel pain, only an abhorrence. I couldn't
touch him as you are doing, not for anything!"</p>

<p>"And you are not pained! <i>You</i>, a woman
with a white soul and a clean heart&mdash;one of
God's choicest creations&mdash;<i>you</i> stand there
without a pang of sorrow&mdash;dry-eyed.
Haven't you a heart, girl?" He rose to his
feet, holding up the lantern until it shone
squarely in her face. "Look at him lying
there! See the blood upon his clothes&mdash;the
look on his face! What he suffered! See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
what he holds so tightly in his hand,&mdash;his last
thought,&mdash;a letter from his sweetheart over in
Germany, the girl he was to have married, who
is even now on her way to him. He had been
reading her letter all day. It came this morning,
and he held it in his hand planning their
future with a happy heart, when some brute
sent a bullet here. If it could have been me,
how gladly I would make the exchange, for I
have nothing that this poor boy possessed&mdash;mother,
sweetheart&mdash;no one. Yet <i>you</i>, a girl, can
see him so, unmoved! Good God, what
are you, <i>stone</i>? See his face, he did not die at
once, and suffering, <i>dying</i>, still held that
letter. If not his story, then does not his suffering
appeal to you? His dying groans,
can you not hear them?"</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried, backing away from him
until she leaned against her horse for support.
"Stop! How <i>dare</i> you talk like that to me!
His <i>groans</i>&mdash;&mdash;" She sobbed wildly, her face
buried in her saddle, which she clutched.</p>

<p>He came close beside her, touching her
lightly, wondering. "I am so sorry, forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
me! I did not realize what I was doing. I
did not wish to frighten you, believe me!"</p>

<p>The sobs were hushed instantly. She raised
her head, and looked at him, still dry-eyed.</p>

<p>"You were right," she said. "I do not
even now <i>feel</i> for him&mdash;perhaps some for the
little girl now on her way to him; but it is all
unreal. I have seen men dead like this before,
and I could not feel anything but horror&mdash;no
sorrow. I am as I am. It makes no difference
what you say,&mdash;what anyone says,&mdash;I
cannot change. I am not tender&mdash;only please
do not terrify me again!"</p>

<p>"I was a brute!" he exclaimed, then left
her and returned to the dead man's side.</p>

<p>The girl stood for some time quietly beside
her horse, then began to loosen the cinch.
Livingston watched her wonderingly as she
drew out the blanket, and secured the saddle
once more into place. He did not realize her
motive until she stood beside him, holding in
her hand the gayly colored saddle blanket.
Kneeling opposite him, beside the body of the
boy, she tenderly lifted the long hair from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
forehead, spread over his face a white handkerchief,
then stood up and unfolded the
blanket, covering the rigid form with it.</p>

<p>"You have a heart!" exclaimed Livingston
softly. "You are thinking of him tenderly,
as a sister might, and of his sweetheart coming
over the water to him!"</p>

<p>"No, not of that at all," said the girl simply,
"nor of him, as you think; but of one who
might be lying here in his place&mdash;one who has
no sweetheart, near or far away, to cover him
with the mantle of her love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood up, listening. From the distance
came the low rumble of a wagon.
The men were returning. For some
time she kept her face from him, in attitude
intent upon the distant rumble. She was
thinking hard. She could not be rude to Livingston,
she could not very well explain, yet
she dared not allow him to accompany her
back to Harris' ranch. What should she do?
Naturally he would insist, yet how could she
tell him that she feared for his safety? That
would sound idiotic without a complete explanation,
for she was almost a total stranger to
him. She was concerned, that was the worst
of it; but not without reason. To-night the
men were in a fever of revenge. If he were
seen that would settle it. To-morrow not
one of them but would hesitate a long time before
committing such a crime; so, she argued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
she had a right to be concerned. But, after all,
how foolish of her! Surely he was not a baby
that he could not protect himself! Did she
expect to worry about him during the whole
summer? As she stood there gazing into the
darkness, he watched her, speechless, something
that was not sorrow piercing his heart
with a greater pain. In her moment of tenderness
she had become to him a woman divine.
He not only loved her, and knew it, but felt
the hopelessness of ever winning her. It was
not exactly new, only revealed to him, for it
had come upon him gradually since the
evening that she had given him the water at
the spring. He had cursed himself that
night for thinking of an Indian girl, he, a man
with a name to sustain&mdash;a name which
counted little in this new country of the West.
He tried to imagine her as married to Carter.
The thought sickened him. Carter might be
all right,&mdash;he had met him when he first came
into the country; he undoubtedly was all
right,&mdash;but married to this girl! As he
thought, bitterly, forgetting even the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
young German at his feet, Hope was alternately
calling herself a fool and wondering
what she could do to prevent him from taking
her home. But her fertile brain could not
solve it. She turned toward him with manner
constrained and frigid. It was shyness,
nothing less, yet it affected him unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"The wagon is coming." Relief sounded
in her tone, giving the lie to her moment of
tenderness. "You can hear it quite plainly.
These corrals should not be so far from the
house. It must be nearly a mile. I suppose
you've not been in the business very long or
you wouldn't have put it here, on the edge of
this cut-bank."</p>

<p>"You are right, Miss Hathaway, I have
not been long in the business nor in your
country. This is quite new to me. Any
place seemed good enough for a corral, to my
ignorant mind. Are you interested in the
sheep industry?" He spoke pleasantly. She
threw back her head as she always did when
angered or excited.</p>

<p>"<i>Interested in the sheep industry?</i> Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
I should say not! It never occurred to me
before as an industry, only as a nuisance. I
hate sheep. They ruin our range. One band
can eat off miles and miles in a season, and
spoil all the water in the country. I would go
miles out of my way to avoid a band of
them."</p>

<p>He began slowly to comprehend. "Your
people have cattle, I understand. Everyone
up here seems to have cattle, too. I have
heard that a strong feeling of antagonism
existed between sheep and cattle owners, but
thought nothing about it. I see that the feeling
is not confined to the men only. Does
that explain this&mdash;outrage here to-night?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly and
turned away.</p>

<p>"You can draw your own conclusions.
Why do you ask me? I am neither a cattle-man
nor a sheep-man, yet I could advise that
you look about the place and see, if you can,
what is meant by it all&mdash;what damage has
been done. The wagon is still some distance
away." Her shyness was fast disappearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
The ground she trod now was her own. He
smiled down at her, finding her more natural,
more prepossessing in that mood.</p>

<p>"I should have thought of that myself before
this. After what you have told me of
your dislike for the animals, I can hardly ask
you to go with me, but I do not like to leave
you here alone in the dark, for I must take the
lantern; however, I can wait until the men get
here."</p>

<p>"You don't need to wait at all," she said
quickly. "I'll go with you, for I am curious
to see what has been done&mdash;the cause of all
this."</p>

<p>"Then come on," said the man briefly, turning
toward the corral. She kept near him,
her eyes following the bright rays of the
lantern that swung in his hand. She feared
that the boys had aimed too low, and was
nervously anxious to see just what mischief
had been done. Almost anything, she
thought, would have been better than permitting
those thousands of sheep to be piled
up at the bottom of the cut-bank and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
brutes of men to ride away satisfied with their
dirty work.</p>

<p>Livingston examined the sheep while Hope,
with a glance here and there about the enclosure,
went to one side and looked at the
panels carefully, discovering many bullet
holes which told that her brave scouts, more
bloodthirsty than she suspected, had aimed
too low.</p>

<p>"I think this one is dead," said Livingston,
dragging out a sheep from the midst of a
number huddled in one corner. "Judging
from the blood, I should say it is shot. A few
are piled up over there from fright, but so
many are sleeping that it will be impossible to
determine the loss until morning. The loss is
small; probably a hundred piled up and hurt,
not more, from the looks of the band. I heard
considerable firing, which lasted about a
minute. I wonder if my friends about here
thought they could kill off a band of sheep so
easily."</p>

<p>Hope had not been searching for sheep, but
for dead or wounded men, and finding none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
breathed easier. She thought of the man
whose hand she had marked and who fell in
such a panic among the sheep. It struck her
as being a very funny incident, and laughed a
little. Livingston heard the laugh and looked
around in wonderment. He could see nothing
amusing. This Western girl was totally different
from any girl that he had known, English
or American. She must possess a sense of
humor out of all proportion with anything of
his conception. He thought a few minutes
before that he loved her, but she seemed far removed
now&mdash;an absolute stranger. The boyish
laugh annoyed him. His manner as he
turned to her was quite as formally polite as
ever her own had been. She resented it, naturally.</p>

<p>"Step outside, please, until I drive in the
ones near the gate, so that I may close it."</p>

<p>Instinctively she obeyed, with a defiant look
which was lost in the dimness of the night, and
hurrying past him never stopped until she
drew back with a shudder at the blanket-covered
form of the dead herder. A deep roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of thunder startled her into a half-suppressed
scream. In the lantern's light she had not
noticed the steadily increasing darkness, or the
flashes of lightning. She felt herself shaking
with a nervous excitement which was half
fear.</p>

<p>Thunderstorms often made her nervous, yet
she would not have acknowledged that she
feared them, or any other thing. But her
nervousness was only the culmination of the
night, every moment of which had been a
strain upon her. Another peal of thunder followed
the first, fairly weakening her. She ran
to her horse and, mounting, rode up near the
corral. At the same instant the wagon came
up, and Livingston, having placed the panel
in position, turned toward it. He was close beside
the girl before he saw her, and she, for an
instant at a loss, sat there speechless; but as he
held up the lantern, looking at her by its light,
she blurted out, in a tone that she had little intention
of using: "I'm going. Hope you
will get along all right. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Wait!" he exclaimed. "I will accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
you. My horse is here now. Just a moment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't need to go with me. Someone
is waiting for me down there. I think I hear
a whistle."</p>

<p>"Then I will go along with you until you
meet the person whose whistle you hear. You
do not imagine that I will allow you to go
alone?"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him impulsively, placing
her hand down upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said softly, "I heard no
whistle. There is no one waiting for me. A
moment ago it seemed easy to lie to you, to
make you believe things that were not absolutely
true, but I can't do it now, nor again&mdash;<i>ever</i>.
You think I am heartless, a creature of
stone&mdash;indifferent. It isn't so. My heart has
held a little place for aching all these years.
Think of me as half-witted,&mdash;idiotic,&mdash;but not
<i>that</i>. Listen to me. You have such a heart&mdash;such
<i>tenderness</i>&mdash;you are good and kind.
You will understand me&mdash;or try to, and not
be offended. I want to go home by myself. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<i>must</i> go back <i>alone</i>. There is a reason which I
will tell you&mdash;sometime. I ask as a favor&mdash;as
a friend to a friend, that you will stay behind."</p>

<p>"But are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "Afraid? Not I!
Why, I was born here, and am a part of it,
and it of me! Ask your men there, they know.
I want to ride like the wind&mdash;alone&mdash;ahead of
the storm, to get there soon. I am tired."
Her low, quick speech bewildered him. Her
words were too inconsistent, too hurried, to
convey any real meaning.</p>

<p>"Will you ride with one of my men?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, why <i>can't</i> you let me do as I
wish!" she cried impatiently. "I want to go
alone."</p>

<p>"It seems quite evident that you do not
want <i>my</i> company, but one of the men must go
and take a lantern. It's too dark to see the
road." His tone was decisive.</p>

<p>She leaned toward him again. This time
her words fell harshly.</p>

<p>"You are a man of your word?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope so; but that is not the issue just
now."</p>

<p>"Then promise you will not go with me to-night."</p>

<p>"No need of that. I have decided to send
one of my men&mdash;and I think," he added
briefly, "that there is no necessity of prolonging
this conversation. Good-evening."</p>

<p>"Then you will not come!" she exclaimed,
relieved. "And never mind telling your man,
for I shall ride like the wind, and will be halfway
home before he can get on his horse." She
turned like a flash. The quick beats of her
horse's hoofs echoed back until the sound was
lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Livingston stood silent, listening, until he
could no longer hear the dull notes on the dry
earth&mdash;his thoughts perturbed as the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Captain Bill Henry, foreman
of the Bar O outfit, and head by choice
of the season's round up, had just ridden
into camp. Most of the men were in the
cook-tent when he turned his dripping bay horse
in with the others. Then he picked up his saddle,
bridle, and blanket and carried them up to
the cook-tent, where he threw them down, hitting
one of the stake-ropes with such violence
as to cause the whole tent to quiver, and one of
the boys inside to mutter under his breath:</p>

<p>"Lord, the Cap's on the prod! What in the
devil's he got in his gizzard now?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," answered the second, returning
from the stove, where he had loaded his
plate with a wonderful assortment of eatables
and seated himself on a roll of bedding beside
the first speaker. "Too bad he couldn't knock
the roof off'n our heads. He's sure enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
mad, just look at him!" he whispered, as Captain
Bill Henry stooped his tall, lank frame to
come into the tent.</p>

<p>The men, sitting about inside, glanced up
when he entered. Some of them grinned,
others went on with their supper, but the
"Cap" from under his bushy red eyebrows
hardly noticed them as he took the necessary
dishes from the mess-box and strode over to
the stove, around which old Evans, the cook,
moved in great concern.</p>

<p>"Now just try some o' them beans.
Regular Boston baked, Cap, they'll melt in
your mouth. An' here's a kidney stew I've
been savin' fer you," taking from the oven a
well concealed stew-pan. "If any o' them
boys 'ud a found it they'd made short work of
it, I reckon."</p>

<p>He removed the cover and held the dish
under Bill Henry's nose. The "Cap" gave
one sniff. "Phew! Take it away! Don't
like the damn'd stuff, nohow!"</p>

<p>A dazed look passed over old Evans' face,
giving way to one of mortal injury. Not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
man smiled, though several seemed about to
collapse with a sudden spasm which they tried
in vain to control. Away went the contents
of the pan, leaving a streak of kidney-stew
almost down to the horse ropes. "If it ain't
good enough fer you, it ain't fer me," said the
cook, his bald head thrown well back upon thin
shoulders.</p>

<p>The "Cap" glared at him as he poured out
a generous measure of strong coffee into a
large tin cup, then ran his eye about the tent
for a possible seat.</p>

<p>A quiet-looking fellow, a youth fresh from
the East, got up, politely offering him the
case of tomatoes upon which he had been sitting.
Bill Henry refused it with a scowl, taking
a seat upon the ground near the front of
the tent, where he crossed his lank legs in front
of him. The cow-puncher sank back upon his
case of tomatoes while the "Cap" ate in great,
hungry mouthfuls, soaking his bread in the
sloppy beans and washing it down with frequent
noisy sips of hot coffee. Finally he began
to speak, with a full Missouri twang:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"This beats hell! Not a dang man around
this part of the country wants to throw in with
this here outfit. Never saw no such luck! Here
we are with two months' steady work before we
make town, an' only ten men to do the work o'
fifteen! I'll hire no more devilish breeds. You
can't trust 'em no more'n you can a rattler, no,
sir! All of 'em quit last night, an' Long Bill
along with 'em! I'd never thought it o' Bill.
Been ridin' all the evenin' an' couldn't find
hair or hide of him. It's enough to make a
man swear a blue streak, yes, sir! Well, I
rounded up one breed limpin' 'round Harris'
shack, an' he said his gun went off by accident
an' give him a scratch on the calf o' the
leg. Bet ten dollars he's been in a fight over
there! Damn'd nest o' drunken louts! I'll
be glad when we're away from these here
parts!"</p>

<p>At this point one of the cowboys got up,
threw his dishes into the pan, and strode outside.</p>

<p>"You on night-herd to-night?" asked the
Captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yep," answered the cow-puncher. "Going
to relieve Jack."</p>

<p>"Tell them other fellers to come along in
an' git their chuck; it's mighty nigh time to
turn in now. Got to make Miller's crossing in
the morning."</p>

<p>"All right," answered the man from outside.
Then putting his head back into the tent, exclaimed
in a loud whisper: "Here comes
Long Bill!"</p>

<p>"The devil he is! It's about time," growled
Bill Henry. He had no more than got the
words out of his mouth before a man, head and
shoulders above any cow-puncher there,
stalked in.</p>

<p>"Well, Cap, I've come round to git paid off,
fer I reckon I'm knocked out of the ring fer a
little spell." He stooped and held down for
inspection a hand bandaged in a much-stained
bandanna handkerchief. "One o' them damn'd
dogs o' Harris' run his teeth all the way
through it," he explained.</p>

<p>The captain grunted, threw his well cleaned
plate over into the dish pan, and rose stiffly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
his feet. "What'd you do to the dog?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"That was his last bite," roared out Long
Bill. "I sent him flyin' into Kingdom Come!"</p>

<p>"Let's see your hand," demanded his chief;
thereupon the tall cowboy hesitated an instant,
then removed the bandage, and, with an
air of bravado, held out his hand for inspection.
Some of the men crowded about curiously,
throwing careless jokes of condolement at the
sufferer, while others passed by regardless.</p>

<p>Captain Bill Henry examined the wounded
member carefully, then grunted again, while
his eyelids contracted until only a sparkle of
liquid blue showed beneath his bushy red brows.</p>

<p>"A mighty bad bite! You'll have a hell of a
time with that hand! What were yo' tryin' to
do, anyhow&mdash;makin' a mark out o' it? Was
you holdin' your hand up, or down, or what?
That <i>dog</i> must 'a' had a pretty good eye. Do
you know what that looks like to me? Well,
sir, it looks mighty like you'd held up your
hand to the muzzle of your gun an' pulled the
trigger! Yes, sir, only there ain't no powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
marks; so I calculate the <i>dog</i> must 'a' been
some distance away when he took aim! The
hole's clean through, just as slick as any bullet
could 'a' made it. That dog must 'a' had a
powerful sharp tooth! Well, you ain't goin'
to be able to handle a rope very soon, dog or no
dog, that's plain as the nose on your face.
You'd make a mighty good ornament to have
around camp, but I reckon I'll pay you off."
Later: "Know of any men I can git around
here?"</p>

<p>"Nary one but them breeds over to
Harris'," replied Long Bill. "They're
drunker'n lords now, but they'll be wantin' a
job in a day or so when they sober up, an' I'll
send 'em 'round here. I'll be huntin' a job myself
in about a month, when this here paw o'
mine gits well. It's mighty painful."</p>

<p>"You'd better go to town an' see a doctor,"
drawled the "Cap." "An' while you're on
your way stop at Hathaway's an' give him or
Jim McCullen a letter fer me. I'll have it
ready in a minute an' it'll save me sendin' a
man over."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply from the tall
cow-puncher, Captain Bill Henry stalked over
to his bed, took from the roll a pad of paper,
and was soon lost in the mysteries of letter-writing.</p>

<p>He was an awkwardly built man, but his
whole appearance gave one the impression that
he meant business&mdash;and he was crammed full
of it. Seated astride his tarp-covered bed,
with his back to the few straggling cow-punchers
about the tents, he proceeded in a
determined, business-like way to write the letter.
Before he had finished the difficult operation
some men rode up to the camp&mdash;the men
who had been on herd, hungry for their supper,
and two outsiders.</p>

<p>Around the mess-wagon, which had been
backed into the cook-tent in the usual order,
lounged a group of cowboys whose appetites
had been satisfied and whose duties for the
time being were over. Two of the men who
had just come up on horseback joined these,
while Captain Bill Henry, without looking
around, continued his somewhat difficult task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of composing a letter, which, when accomplished,
he folded carefully.</p>

<p>"Hello! Where did you'ns drop from?"
he drawled as he approached the newcomers.
"I was just goin' to send word over to have
your wagon join me at west fork o' Stony
Creek. I'm too short o' men to work Stony
Creek country, anyhow. Hathaway's reps all
left me awhile back, an' Long Bill, he's leavin'
to-day&mdash;got bit by a mad dog over here. Jackson's
wagon an' the U Bar ain't goin' to join
me till we git down in the Lonesome Prairie
country, so I was just goin' to send a letter over
to your place, for if he wants a good round-up
on this range he'd better send over that extra
wagon o' his'n. You'ns goin' right back?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," replied Carter. "But McCullen
can take word over to the ranch. He's going
the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Cert. Got to go, anyway, an' I reckon my
horse can pack your message to the boss if it
ain't too heavy," said McCullen.</p>

<p>Old Jim McCullen had been Hathaway's
right hand man as long as anyone could re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>member.
He had put in many years as wagon-boss,
and finally retired from active life to the
quieter one at the home-ranch, where he drew
the biggest pay of any man in Hathaway's
employ, and practically managed all the details
of the great cattle concern. He saw that
the wagons were properly provisioned,
manned, and started out in the spring, that the
men who brought up the trail-herds were paid
off; he attended to the haying, the small irrigating
plant that had been started, and to all
the innumerable details that go toward the
smooth running of a large ranch. Now the
"boss" had sent him on a mission whose import
he understood perfectly&mdash;something altogether
out of the line of his usual duties, but of
greater importance than anything he had ever
undertaken. He was going back to the ranch
in the morning to tell Hathaway that his
daughter was apparently all right. He and
Carter had pitched their tent not far from
where the round-up was camped, and had ridden
over for some beef. One of the men cut
them a liberal piece from a yearling that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
had just butchered. Carter tied it upon the
back of his saddle and rode off toward camp,
while old Jim McCullen sat down, lighted a
cigarette, and listened to the gossip of the
round-up.</p>

<p>"Right smart lot o' dogs round them breeds
down there," remarked Bill Henry, nodding
his head toward Harris' ranch. "Long Bill,
here, he's been unfortunate. Went up there
a-courtin' one o' them pretty Harris girls last
eyenin', an' blamed if she didn't go an' sick the
dogs on him!"</p>

<p>McCullen sized up his bandaged hand.
"Mighty bad-lookin' fist there," he chuckled.
"Must 'a' bled some by the looks of that rag.
When'd it happen?"</p>

<p>"This mornin', just as I was startin' to come
over to camp."</p>

<p>"You don't tell!" condoled the visitor.
"That's mighty bad after sitting up all-night
with your best girl!"</p>

<p>"Long Bill's pretty intent after them breed
girls," remarked Captain Bill Henry; thereupon
the cowboy flushed angrily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"No breed girls in mine! The new school-marm's
more to my likin'," he boasted. "An'
from the sweet looks she give me, I reckon I
ain't goin' to have no trouble there!"</p>

<p>The next instant Long Bill lay sprawling in
the dust, while old Jim McCullen rained blow
after blow upon him. When he finished, Long
Bill remained motionless, the blood streaming
from his nose and mouth. Old Jim straightened
up and looked down at the fallen giant
with utmost contempt, then he pulled his disarranged
cartridge belt into shape and glanced
at his hands. They were covered with the cowboy's
blood.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'd better wash up a bit," he remarked
easily, and went into the cook-tent.</p>

<p>The men lounged about, apparently indifferent
to the scene which was being enacted.
It might have been an every day occurrence, so
little interest they showed, yet several stalwart
fellows gave old Jim McCullen an admiring
glance as he passed them.</p>

<p>On the crest of a near divide stood a group
of squaws. After a short conference they pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ceeded
slowly, shyly toward the round-up
camp. Some distance from it they grouped
together again and waited while a very old
woman wrapped in a dingy white blanket
came boldly up to the group of men, and in a
jargon of French and Indian asked for the
refuse of the newly killed yearling. The foreman
pointed to where it lay, and gruffly told
her to go and get it, but she spied the unconscious
figure of Long Bill stretched out upon
the grassy flat, and with a low cry of woe flung
herself down beside him.</p>

<p>"Who done this?" she cried in very plain
English, facing the cowboys with a look of
blackest anger. No answer came.</p>

<p>"Better tell her," suggested a cow-puncher
who was unrolling his bed. "She's a witch,
you know."</p>

<p>"If she's a witch she don't need no telling,"
replied another, at which they all laughed.</p>

<p>"A witch?" said one. "I sure thought
witches were all burned up!"</p>

<p>The old squaw was examining the fallen
man, who began to show signs of consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
She bristled like a dog at the cowboy's remark.</p>

<p>"<i>I see beyond!</i> I know the future, the past,
<i>everything</i>!" she cried impressively. "I read
your thoughts! Say what you like, you dogs,
but not one o' you would like me to tell what I
read in your lives. <i>I know! I know! I know
everything!</i>" Her voice reached a high, weird
cry. Her blanket had slipped down, leaving
her hair in wisps about her mummified face.
To all appearances she might have been a genuine
witch as she groveled over Long Bill.</p>

<p>"Ask her how she tells fortunes&mdash;cards or
tea-leaves," said one.</p>

<p>"Or by the palm of your hand or the stars
above," suggested another.</p>

<p>"Wonder where she keeps her broomstick,"
mused a third.</p>

<p>Just then McCullen came out of the cook-tent
and faced the spectacle.</p>

<p>"I see he's found a nurse," he remarked,
and walked over to his horse.</p>

<p>The old woman stood and gesticulated
wildly, throwing mad, incoherent words at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
him. Finally her jargon changed into fair
English.</p>

<p>"You dog, <i>you</i> did this! And why? Ah,
ha, ha! <i>I know!</i> I know all things! Because
of the white girl! So! Ha, ha! Must you
alone love the white girl so that no man can
speak her name? Oh, you can't deny you
love her! <i>You</i>, who ride and hunt with her for
fifteen years. Cannot another man open his
mouth but that you must fly at him? Ha, ha!
<i>I know!</i>"</p>

<p>"I'll wring your neck, you old&mdash;&mdash;!" said
McCullen at his horse's head.</p>

<p>"You will stop my tongue, will you! I'll
show you! You are up here to watch that girl&mdash;but
where's your eyes? What are you
doing? This is my son-in-law, and you'd like
to wipe him from the face of the earth! You
beat him in the face&mdash;him with one hand! See!
How did he get it? Why are some of my
other son-in-laws limping about with bullets
in their legs? Why is a man lying dead up in
the mountains? Why all this at once? Ask
that white girl who teaches little children to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
good! Ask that devil's child who can put a
bullet straight as her eye! <i>Ask her!</i> She
would destroy my people. Curse her soul, I
say!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the witch-like spirit in her seemed
to shrivel into the blanket which she wrapped
about her, then with placid, expressionless face
she made her way to where the yearling had
been butchered and hurriedly stuffed the refuse
into a gunny sack which she dragged to
where the other squaws were waiting, then
they all made off.</p>

<p>Long Bill sat up and looked about him.
"Curse who?" he asked. "Curse me, I
reckon fer not knowin' enough to keep my
mouth shut!"</p>

<p>McCullen, with face and lips pallid, had
mounted his horse. Long Bill pulled himself
together and walked over toward him.</p>

<p>"I'll take that back," he said. "I didn't
mean it, nohow."</p>

<p>"I reckon I was over-hasty," McCullen replied.
"But that was our little girl you were
talkin' about&mdash;little Hope; an' no man on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
earth, let alone a common squaw-man, ain't
goin' to even breathe her name disrespectfully.
She's like my own child. I've almost brought
her up. Learned her little baby fingers to
shoot, an' had her on a horse before she could
talk plain. Don't let her find this out, for I'm
plumb sorry I had to hurt you; but the man
who says more than you did <i>dies</i>!" He rode
away and soon was lost in the deep falling
shadows. The men in the cow-camp unrolled
their bedding, and all was soon one with the
stillness of the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>All the small ranchers and disreputable
stragglers about that immediate
vicinity were of one opinion in regard
to the new sheep-man. This particular section
of the country promised to be soon over-crowded
with cattle and horses. There was no
room in their mountains for sheep. Livingston,
the interloper, must vacate. That was
the unanimous decision of the whole Harris
faction. This gang was a mixture of badness,
a scum of the roughest element from the
face of the globe, which in new countries invariably
drifts close upon the heels of the first
settlers. It is the herald of civilization, but
fortunately goes on before its advance to
other fields or is deeply buried in its midst.
The breeds, pliable to the strong will of Joe
Harris, were not an unimportant factor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
among these, old Mother White Blanket was
the ruling spirit.</p>

<p>She lived in a tepee not a rod to the left of
Harris' squalid log buildings. Her daughter
was the cattle-man's wife, therefore the old
woman had particular rights about the premises,
a mother-in-law's rights, more honored
and considered among Indians than among
civilized whites.</p>

<p>Her tepee was the usual Indian affair, its
conical, pointed top, dingy with the smoke of
many camp-fires. Back of the old woman's
tepee, at various distances, stood a few ordinary
wall tents. These were occupied by the
families of some breeds who were working for
Harris. The whole, heightened by numerous
dogs and the old squaw stooping over her fire,
presented the appearance of a small Indian
camp, such as may be seen about any reservation.
The old woman's rattle-trap cart stood
beside her lodge, for she had her periods of
wandering, after the manner of her race. The
running gears of a couple of dilapidated
wagons were drawn up between the other tents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and not far away two closely hobbled horses,
unmistakably Indian, for horses resemble
their human associates, fed eagerly upon the
short, new grass.</p>

<p>At an early hour, when the rising sun cast
rosy lights upon every grass-covered mountain
top, when bird notes from the distant
brush sounded the most melodious, when the
chanticleer in the barnyard became loudest in
his crowing, when the dew of night began to
steam upward in its vitality-giving stream,
when the pigs with a grunt rose lazily upon
their fore-legs, and old Mother White Blanket
bent over the smoke of her newly built camp-fire,
the girl school-teacher came out of her
room and leaned against the smooth rain-washed
logs of the building. She drew in with
every deep breath new vitality to add to her
plentiful fund of it, she saw the rosy glow
upon the mountains, listened in awe and rapture
to the bird notes from the brush, and
finally brought herself back to more material
things; to old Mother White Blanket and the
Indian scene spread out before her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The old woman was bending over the fire
apparently unconscious of the girl's presence.
From the school children Hope had learned
something of the wonderful perceptive powers
of Mother White Blanket. They had innumerable
stories of witchcraft to tell, as various
as they were astonishing, and, while crediting
nothing, she felt a quickened interest
in the old squaw. But she had so far no opportunity
to cultivate her acquaintance. Generally
the spaces between the tents were filled
with groups of breeds, and these she had no inclination
to approach. Now, quiet pervaded
the place. No one except the old woman and
herself were about. She knew full well that
the squaw had seen her, but on an impulse
walked over beside the tepee, spreading out
her hands to the warmth of the fire.</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" she exclaimed. Mother
White Blanket made no reply, and turning
her back proceeded to fill a large black kettle
with water.</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" repeated Hope in
French, to which greeting the old woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
grunted, while she placed the kettle over the
fire.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," continued Hope. "I
forgot for the moment you were French."</p>

<p>At this old White Blanket stood up, anger
bristling all over her.</p>

<p>"What you come here for? You stand
there and make fun. You think I don't know
you make fun at me? Go away, girl, or you be
sorry! You call me French and laugh to yourself.
Go away, I say!"</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "I shall not go away
until it pleases me. I have heard that you are
a great woman, a witch, and I want to find out
if it is true." She had not one particle of belief
in the old woman's generally credited
supernatural powers, but she thought she
must possess sharp wit to so deceive the people
and was curious to know more about her. This
she was destined to do.</p>

<p>"I have heard," she continued, "that you
can bring the wild deer to your side by calling
to them, that a horse or cow will lie down and
die when you command, and that little chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>dren
who annoy you are taken with severe pains
in their stomachs. I have heard that you can
say 'go' to any of your men or women and
they go; that if anyone is sick you can lay your
hand on them and they are well, and that you
can tell the future and the past of anyone. If
all these things are true you must be a very
great, remarkable woman. Is it true that you
can do all these things?" She waited a moment
and, as the old woman offered no reply,
went on: "Whether you can do these things
or not, you still remain, in my eyes, a remarkable
woman in possessing the ability to make
people believe that you can."</p>

<p>"You shall believe them too, <i>you</i>!" said
the woman, suddenly rising and confronting
the girl.</p>

<p>As she spoke two yellow fangs of teeth
protruded from her thin lips, and on her
face was the snarl of a dog. She drew up her
mummified face within two inches of the girl's
own. Hope shuddered and involuntarily
moved backward toward the house. With
every step she took the squaw followed, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
weazened face and cruel, baneful eyes held
close to hers.</p>

<p>"You murderer of men, you teacher of little
children, you butcher, I will show you my
power!"</p>

<p>The girl recoiled from the frenzied woman,
shutting out the sight with her hands and moving
backward step by step until she leaned
against the smooth logs of the building.
There the foolishness of her sudden fright
presented itself. Should the grimaces of a
weazened old squaw frighten her into a fit, or
should she pick up the bony thing and throw
her over the top of the tepee? An impulse to
do the latter came over her&mdash;then to her fancy
she could hear the crashing of brittle bones.
What she did do, however, was to take her
hands away from her eyes and look at the old
witch fearlessly. At this old White Blanket
broke into a terrible jargon, not a word of
which was intelligible. Her voice rose to its
utmost pitch. The crisp morning air resounded
with its sharp intonations.</p>

<p>Hope leaned against the logs of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
lashing the squaw into greater fury by her cool,
impertinent gaze. She began to be interested
in the performance, speculating to just what
degree of rage the old woman would reach
before she foamed at the mouth, and as to how
much strength she would have to exert to pitch
the frail thing bodily into the top of the tepee.</p>

<p>At that instant a man, apparently hurriedly
dressed, rushed from the lodge and grasped
the old woman by the arm.</p>

<p>"What're you doin'? Go over there and git
my breakfast, and don't be all day about it!"</p>

<p>The old woman's face changed marvelously.
She calmed like a dove, under the hand of her
son-in-law, but before turning away began
muttering what might have been intended for
an apology.</p>

<p>"I no hurt her. She think I know nothing.
I <i>show</i> her."</p>

<p>The man laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Well, you show me some grub an' that'll be
enough fer one day, I reckon. Wimmen folks
should be seen an' not heard, an' you make as
much noise as an old guinea hen." Meekly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
old woman continued her interrupted task,
showing that in spite of his gruff speech she
entertained great respect for her tall son-in-law,
Long Bill.</p>

<p>"Hope the old woman didn't frighten you,
Miss. She don't mean nothin' by it, only she
gits them spells once in a while," apologized
Long Bill politely. Hope gave a short laugh,
while the man continued: "Seems like all
Hades is turned loose when she does git on the
rampage, though."</p>

<p>"Probably I aggravated her. If so, I am
sorry. But I wouldn't have missed it&mdash;not
for anything. Her rage was perfect&mdash;such
gestures, and <i>such</i> expressions!"</p>

<p>At her words the man smiled, holding up to
his face as he did so a bandaged hand. In an
instant her eyes were riveted upon it. She had
searched for that hand since Saturday evening
among all the men she had chanced to see.
That this great, strong fellow possessed it
eased her conscience, if, indeed, it had greatly
troubled her. She wanted to get him to talk
about the hand, but shifted her eyes from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to the old woman moving slowly before the
tepee.</p>

<p>"She seems a very interesting woman,"
she remarked casually to Long Bill, who
through sheer awkwardness made no attempt
to move away.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a little locoed, but barrin' that
she's smarter'n a steel trap. They ain't nothin'
goin' on but she's got her eye peeled. If she
takes a likin' to anyone she'll just about break
her neck to please, but," he added in a lower
voice, "if she ain't a-likin' anyone she's just
about the <i>orneriest</i>, <i>cussedest</i>&mdash;&mdash;" Words
failed, in view of the critical eyes before him.</p>

<p>"Do you belong to the family?" asked
Hope, observing: "I noticed you came from
the tepee."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied the man awkwardly,
"I sort of do&mdash;that is, I did. I married
her youngest girl awhile back, but I ain't
sure now we're goin' to make it a go. You see
I 'lowed to meet her here when the round-up
come 'round to these parts, but here's she's
done run off to Canada with some o' her folks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and I ain't set eyes on her fer nigh on to four
months. But we've been spliced all right
'nough, an' the old woman's mighty fond o'
me."</p>

<p>"I should think you would be glad of that!"
exclaimed Hope. "It would be too bad if she
didn't like you. I am sorry she is not in a more
amiable mood, for I'd really like to talk with
her; but perhaps I will be permitted to approach
her later in the day."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be all right, now she's had her
spell out," assured Long Bill.</p>

<p>"You speak of the round-up; why are you
not with it?" queried the girl, with cool intent.</p>

<p>Long Bill brought his huge bandaged fist
up before him, resting it upon the well one.</p>

<p>"I had a little accident th' other day," he
explained, "an' hurt my hand powerful bad.
It ain't goin' to be much use fer handlin' a rope
fer quite a spell. Had to let the round-up
move away without me." His voice grew
plaintive.</p>

<p>She spoke quickly, with great compassion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
"I am sorry! It seems too bad to see a great
big fellow like you disabled. How did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this: I come over here th'
other night an' got to settin' 'round here doin'
nothin', so I thought I'd improve th' time an'
clean this here gun o' mine. It's been a-needin'
it powerful bad fer awhile back. I didn't
know there was nary load in it until the blame
thing went off an' I felt somethin' kind o' sudden
an' hot piercin' my left hand. It was a
fool trick to do, but it's the gospel truth, Miss."</p>

<p>"I heard&mdash;that is, the boys said something
about a shooting affair up the road." She
pointed toward the sheep-man's ranch. "I
thought for a moment that perhaps you had
been mixed up in that. I'm very glad to
know that you were not, because you know it
wasn't a very nice, manly thing to do to a defenseless
stranger." Her cool eyes watched
his nervous shifting. "You see I can't very
well help hearing a lot of things around here.
The girls hear things and they tell me, and then
I am often forced to overhear the men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
boys talking among themselves. It's none of
my business, but yet I am glad to know that
you were not one to set upon an innocent white
man. I scarcely know this Mr. Livingston by
sight, but he is a friend of Sydney's, my cousin,
and they say,"&mdash;here she drew out her words
slowly and impressively,&mdash;"that over in his
country he has been in the army and is well
versed in firearms; also that he has a small
Gatling gun with him over here that shoots
hundreds of shots a minute. So he really isn't
so defenseless as he seems." This startled the
man into open-mouth astonishment.</p>

<p>"I thought there was something!&mdash;I mean I
thought, when I heard tell about the fracas
over there, that there was somethin' like that
in the wind," stammered the man.</p>

<p>Apparently Hope had told a deliberate untruth
to force a confession from Long Bill,
but yet it was a fact that she had heard something
very similar. On the day before, Sunday,
Jim McCullen had come to visit her.
From his camp the noise of the shooting had
been plainly heard, and through curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
he and Carter had ridden to Livingston's
ranch to inquire into it, but the sheep-man had
been very reticent about the matter. Had told
them only that there had been trouble with
some breeds, and his herder had been killed.
This old Jim repeated to Hope, adding that
Livingston must have a Gatling gun concealed
on his place, judging from the sound of the
firing. So Hope in her effort to impress the
tall cow-puncher had not used her imagination
wholly.</p>

<p>"I am glad you had nothing to do with it,"
she concluded, walking slowly away toward
the kitchen end of the house. "And I hope
your hand will soon be well."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Long Bill. "I didn't
have nothin' to do with it. No Gatlin' guns
in mine, Miss!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>"We'll beat any cow-pony workin'
on the round-up," declared the
soft-voiced twin as he coiled up the
stake-rope and tied it on to his saddle.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon of the
same day. School had been dismissed and the
dozen children of various sizes were straggling
homeward. Hope stood beside her horse
patiently waiting for the twins to go, but they
seemed in no particular hurry. She listened
absent-mindedly to the boys' conversation.</p>

<p>"An' another thing about this pony o' mine,
he'll never slack up on a rope," continued
Dan. "Once you've got a rope on a steer
he'll never budge till the cinch busts off the
saddle. He'll just sit right back on his
haunches an' <i>pull</i>. Yes, sir; you'd think he
knew just as much as a man!"</p>

<p>Dave grunted. "He's all right 'nough, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
he'll bust the bridle if you tie him, an' he won't
stand without bein' tied. He'll buck if he's
cinched too tight or gets too much to eat, an'
he ain't fit for a lady to ride, nohow. He's an
Indian pinto to boot, a regular fool calico
pony! Now <i>my</i> horse is an all 'round good
one, an' so gentle any lady can ride him, just
like any sensible horse ought to be."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all he's good for, is to stand
'round an' look pretty, like some o' these here
bloods&mdash;an' them pretty soldiers over to the
post. I notice when there's any real work to
be done, Mr. Dude ain't in it. Oh, he can
stand 'round an' look pretty all right, but the
pinto's the best all 'round, an's got the most
sense!"</p>

<p>Their discussion seemed at an end, for the
soft-voiced twin having fastened the rope
securely, walked around to the other side of his
pinto and had just turned the stirrup toward
him, preliminary to mounting, when the other
boy grasped him roughly by the collar, throwing
him backward to the ground.</p>

<p>"That's my lariat; you hand it over here!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
he exclaimed gruffly; thereupon the soft-voiced
twin picked himself up, very carefully
brushed the dust from his sleeve, and answered
slowly, in a particularly sweet tone:</p>

<p>"I ain't a-goin' to fight you here in front of
the teacher. That's my rope. Go an' get it
if you want it! But <i>she's</i> got yourn. I saw
her pick it up by mistake this mornin'. You've
tied up your dude cayuse twice with her'n to-day.
Must have somethin' the matter with
your eyes. I ain't a-goin' to lick you er fight
with you, but I'm goin' to get even with you
for this!"</p>

<p>"Here's your rope," said Hope, taking it
from her saddle and handing it to the boy.
Dave took it shamefacedly, throwing her rope
on the ground, then hid himself on the opposite
side of his pony. In an instant the soft-voiced
twin picked up the teacher's stake-rope,
coiled it, and tied it on to her saddle.</p>

<p>The girl stood to one side watching him.
She wondered at his quickness. He must have
inherited something of his grandmother's
acuteness. But her sympathy turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
other boy&mdash;big, clumsy, rough Dave. He
was standing out of sight behind his horse, embarrassed
by his own error. Hope felt sorry
for him. She had already found it very difficult
to keep peace between these boys and herself.
Each day brought some new ruffle that
required all her wit to smooth over.</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin handed the bridle reins
to her, then turned to his own horse, which
had wandered away toward more tempting
pasture. The girl thanked him, and walked
over to Dave. He looked at her sullenly, a
certain dogged obstinacy in his eyes. She had
intended to say something kind to him, instead
she spoke indifferently, yet to the point.</p>

<p>"Go home with Dan the same as usual. Say
nothing about it, but get my rifle and meet me
here at the school in two hours&mdash;six o'clock.
There is a big flock of chickens that fly over
that point every evening."</p>

<p>The boy made no reply, but his face changed
noticeably, and he jumped on his horse, calling
his twin to hurry up; but the soft-voiced boy
had no notion of leaving his teacher, so Dave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
with a savage whoop, ran his pony to the top
of the hill, leaving the school-house and his
uncomfortable feelings far in the background.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go with him?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"I'm waitin' for you," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"But I'm not going just now. You'd better
run along with Dave."</p>

<p>"I ain't in no hurry."</p>

<p>"Aren't you? Well, that is good, for I just
happened to think of something. I want you
to go down to Pete La Due's place where they
are branding, and hang around awhile and
keep your ears open. There will be a lot of
breeds there, and some of those men over on
Crow Creek, and maybe something will be said
that we ought to know about. You understand.
You are my faithful scout, you know.
And another thing&mdash;don't try to pay Dave
back for what he did. He's sorry enough
about it."</p>

<p>The boy's face took on a shrewd, determined
expression, causing him at once to look years
older. For an instant Hope imagined that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
resembled his aged grandmother, old White
Blanket, the "witch."</p>

<p>"I'll go over there," he replied, "an' I'll see
what I can find out, but about Dave&mdash;I'll get
even with him if it takes me ten years. He
needs teachin'."</p>

<p>"We all do," said the girl thoughtfully.
"I have begun a series of lessons myself&mdash;on
humanity. No, on sympathy, on what is expected
of a womanly woman. We're lucky
when we have a good teacher, aren't we? But
it's pretty hard to learn what doesn't come
natural. Remember Dave isn't like you. He
wasn't made like you, and never will be like
you. Think of this, and don't be hard on him,
that's a good boy."</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin smiled sweetly, and
mounting his horse, remarked:</p>

<p>"I expect I'd better be movin' over there if
I'm goin' to find out anything to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hope, pleased that he should
leave her at last. "I think you're right. Be
sure to come home before bedtime and
<i>report</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy dug his heels into the pinto's sides,
starting off on a bound. She watched him,
absent-mindedly, until he disappeared over the
hill-top, then she rode away at a lively canter
toward the sheep-man's ranch.</p>

<p>A horseman came rapidly toward her before
she reached Livingston's gate. It was a slender,
boyish figure, who sat his horse with
remarkable ease and grace. The girl frowned
savagely when she saw him, but only for an
instant. He waved his hat above his dark head
and called to her from the distance. His voice
possessed a rich musical ring which might
have stood for honesty and youthful buoyancy.</p>

<p>When Hope met him she was smiling. In
fun she passed rapidly, seeing which he wheeled
his horse about, caught up with her, and leaning
far over, grasped the bridle, bringing her
horse to a stand-still beside him. It was an old
trick of his boyhood. The girl's ringing
laughter reached a small group of men at work
with shovels upon the rise of a green knoll not
far away. They stopped work and listened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
but the notes died away and nothing more
could be heard.</p>

<p>"That wasn't fair, Syd!" she cried. "I
thought you'd forgotten it. I was going to
run you a race."</p>

<p>"Rowdy's thin, he couldn't run. A stake-rope
don't agree with him, and I'll bet he
hasn't seen an oat since you've been here," he
answered, growing sober. "Hopie, dear, leave
these breeds and go home, that's a good girl!
I can't bear to have you stay there. You've
been up here a week and you look thin already.
I'll bet you're starving right now! Come, own
up, aren't you hungry?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of it," replied Hope.
"But now that you remind me, I believe I am&mdash;the
least bit. A steady diet of eggs&mdash;boiled
in their <i>own</i> shells, is apt to make one hungry
at times for a good dinner. But what's the
difference? I feel fine. It certainly agrees."</p>

<p>"But that's terrible! Eggs! Eggs only&mdash;eggs
in the shell. Haven't you brought yourself
to meat, bread, and potatoes yet? Eggs
only! It's a joke, Hope, but somehow I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
feel amused. I've eaten eggs for a meal or
two, around those places, but a week of it!
Hope, your father wants you. Go home to
him!"</p>

<p>"No; you see it's this way, Sydney, I
couldn't if I would, and I wouldn't if I could.
I couldn't because father told me to stay until
the school term ended, and I wouldn't because&mdash;I
like it here. It's new and exciting. I feel
just like a boy does in going out into the world
for the first time. You know how that is, Syd,
how you roamed about for months and months.
You had your fling and then you were satisfied."</p>

<p>"I know," said Carter softly, stroking her
horse's neck. "But you had such a free
'fling' there at the ranch, what else could you
want? You had your choice between the ranch
and New York. You could travel if you
wished. Surely there was nothing left to be
desired. You can't make me believe that you
really like it up here among these breeds,
teaching a handful of stupid children their
A B C's! I can't see the attraction. Clarice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Van Rensselaer with the Cresmonds and that
little jay Englishman, Rosehill, are due at the
ranch this week. You like Clarice; go home,
Hope, and look after things there. You're
needed, and you know it. Do go, that's a good
girlie!"</p>

<p>"Don't say anything more about it to me,
Sydney. I can't go, I'm not going, and I want
to forget for this one summer about the ranch
and everyone on it."</p>

<p>"I am wasting my breath, but yet," he
looked at her searchingly, "I don't understand
you in this. I see no attraction here for you.
Why, even the hunting isn't good! I'll not
admit that there is any attraction for you in
this Englishman over here. You've known
dozens of them, and you've always expressed
an aversion to every one. I'm not going to be
scared of one lone Englishman!" He grasped
her hand and his face darkened. "Hope, if I
thought you would ever care for him I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted:</p>

<p>"You need not finish that! Show a little
manhood! Oh, Syd, a moment ago you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
my dear old companion&mdash;my brother, and
now&mdash;&mdash;If you knew how I detest you in this!
It is not yourself&mdash;your dear self, at all, but
the very devil that has taken possession of you.
Sydney, are you sure there isn't something the
matter with your brain? Do you realize how
awful it seems? Doesn't it make you feel
ashamed of yourself when you think of all the
sweetness of our past life? It makes me, Syd.
Sometimes at night before I go to sleep I
think of the way you've acted lately, and I can
feel a hot flush creep all over my face. It
makes me so ashamed! I've grown up with
you for my brother, I think of you always as
my brother, and this makes a new person out
of you&mdash;a person whom I neither love nor
respect. Syd, dear Syd, forget it and I will
never think of it again, for I will have my
brother back. I loved you, Sydney, you and
father, better than anyone else in this world.
And now&mdash;&mdash;" She turned her head away
from him and began to cry quietly. In an
instant he was filled with commiseration and
tenderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't, Hope!" he exclaimed, bending close
to her. "I can't stand anything like that!
Don't cry. I'm sorry, girlie. I've been a fool,
a brute, a low-lived beggar, but I can't stand
tears from <i>you</i>! Here you're hungry, starving,
living among a lot of breeds, and I've added
more to your misery. It's all a mistake. I
know now when I see you crying&mdash;don't do it,
dear! You've never cried since you were a
baby, and now you're such a great big girl.
The other feeling's all gone. I guess it must
have been because you were the only girl out
here and I let myself think of you that way
until it grew on me. But you are my sister&mdash;my
dear little pard!"</p>

<p>He had dismounted and stood beside her.
Now he reached up and took her hands away
from her face. She was ashamed of her tears,
as people are who seldom cry, and hastily
mopped her face with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad, Syd, dear!" she exclaimed in
a moment, then reached down and kissed him.
"What a baby you must think I am!"</p>

<p>"Your tears woke me up, dear; don't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
sorry. Maybe some time they'll make a man
out of me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you were a man all the time,
only you didn't know it. You don't know how
happy I was all at once when you called me
'pard' again. I knew then I had my brother
back."</p>

<p>The young fellow mounted his horse again.
His own eyes were suspiciously moist.</p>

<p>"And I have my sister, which seems better
than anything to me," he said. Then they
both laughed.</p>

<p>"I was going to the Englishman's," said
Hope, "to see if I could help any about the
poor herder who was shot."</p>

<p>"They're burying him now," announced
her cousin, "right around the bend of this hill
just inside the fence. Do you want to go over
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do," she replied. "I want
to ask Mr. Livingston when the little German
girl is expected to arrive and what is going to
be done about her."</p>

<p>"The herder's sister?" asked Sydney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, his sweetheart. Just think, Sydney,
his little sweetheart, who is on her way to
marry him! Isn't it sad? Who will meet her
and who will tell her, I wonder, and what will
she do? How are such things managed, I
wonder. Isn't it terrible, Syd?"</p>

<p>"Some beggars around here shot the poor
fellow, Livingston told me. The whole bunch
ought to be hanged for it."</p>

<p>"It was a cowardly thing to do!" exclaimed
the girl.</p>

<p>"Sheep in a cattle country, the same old
story. I imagine old Harris is a pretty strong
element here. They've driven out a couple of
bands already. Someone ought to put Livingston
next. But he probably scents the
situation now from this occurrence. He is one
of the kind who trusts everyone. I met him
last fall in town when he first came out here.
He has put a lot of money into this business,
and I'd like to see him make it a go. He'll
have something to learn by experience."</p>

<p>"Isn't it too bad he didn't invest in cattle?"
deplored Hope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, though they say there's bigger returns
in sheep." He pointed ahead. "You
can't see the men, but they're just around that
point of rocks, though they must be about
through with the job by now."</p>

<p>"You'll go along, won't you? Then you
can ride back to the school-house with me.
I'm going to meet one of the twins there at six
o'clock, and we're going to see if we can get
some chickens."</p>

<p>"If you will promise to bring the chickens
over to the camp and let the cook get you up
a good, square meal," he replied. "Jim will be
back before dark."</p>

<p>"If I shouldn't happen to get any birds,"
she asked, "does the invitation still hold
good?"</p>

<p>"Pard!" he reproved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Livingston stood alone beside the
fresh mound, hatless, with head bowed
in deep meditation. His men had
returned to their respective duties, having
shown their last kindness toward the young
herder gone on before them to the great,
mysterious Beyond.</p>

<p>When Hope and her companion rounded
the point of rocks inside the pasture fence
they came directly upon the sheep-man and the
newly made grave. The girl reined in her
horse suddenly.</p>

<p>"Syd," she said softly, wonderingly, "he's
<i>praying</i>!" She had an impulse to flee before
he should see her, and with a look communicated
the thought to Sydney, but Livingston
turned around and came quickly down
the grassy slope toward them. He greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
them cordially, heartily shaking hands with
each.</p>

<p>"Is this not a beautiful day? I am glad you
have come, Miss Hathaway. I wanted you to
see this spot. Could any place be prettier?
See this green slope and the gigantic ridge of
rocks beside it."</p>

<p>"It's magnificent!" she exclaimed. "What
a monument!"</p>

<p>"I had an idea he would like it if he could
know," he continued. "Day after day he
has stood up there on that point of rocks and
watched his sheep."</p>

<p>Hope pointed across the valley to where the
grassy slope terminated in a deep cut-bank,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"There is the corral!" It came involuntarily.
She shot a quick glance at her
cousin, but he was gazing thoughtfully at the
magnificence of the scene before him, and had
not noticed the words, or her confusion which
followed them, which was fortunate, she
thought.</p>

<p>If asked she could not have explained why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
she felt in this manner about it, and it is certain
that she did ask herself. She had probably
saved Livingston's sheep. Well, what of
it? She only knew that she wanted no one to
find it out, least of all Livingston himself.
She had a half fear that if Sydney ever got
an inkling of it he might sometime tell him, and
Sydney was very quick; so she adroitly eased
her involuntary exclamation by remarking:</p>

<p>"That is a queer place to put a corral!
Aren't you afraid of a pile up so near the
bank?"</p>

<p>"I am not using it now," he replied. "I
put it there because Fritz ran his band on
that side and it was more convenient not to
drive them so far. I am using this shed below
here, at present."</p>

<p>Sydney looked at Hope and began to laugh,
then leaned over toward Livingston and
placed his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"She'll be telling you how to run your sheep
next. You mustn't mind her, though, for she's
been teaching school a whole week, and dictating
is getting to be sort of second nature with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
her, isn't it, Hopie? And besides that she isn't
responsible. A steady diet of hard-boiled eggs
isn't conducive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him with a gesture, laughing.</p>

<p>"That's awfully true, only I haven't eaten
even hard-boiled eggs since breakfast, and I'm
famished! It was cruel of you to remind me,
Syd!"</p>

<p>"You poor youngster!" he exclaimed in
real commiseration. "Is it as bad as that?
I'm going over and start supper at once. The
camp is just over the hill there, up that next
draw." He pointed ahead, then looked at his
watch. "It's after five now. You keep your
appointment with the half-breed, but never
mind the chickens till you've had a square
meal."</p>

<p>She nodded in answer, smiling at him.</p>

<p>"They're starving her over there," he explained
to Livingston, who looked at them in
some wonderment. "They don't feed her anything
but boiled eggs. Tell him why you
don't eat anything but eggs, Hope, boiled,&mdash;hard
and soft,&mdash;in their <i>own shells</i>. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
you can get them to bake you a potato or two
in their <i>own jackets</i>!"</p>

<p>"What an idea! I never thought of that,"
she exclaimed. "You're a genius, Syd. But
go home or I shall famish! I'll meet Dave and
come right over there. I think the chickens
will fly that way to-night, anyway, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course they will," replied her cousin,
"they fly right over the top of my tent every
evening!" Then he started away, but turned
about quickly as though he had forgotten
something, and asked Livingston if he would
not come over to camp for supper, too.</p>

<p>Livingston looked up into the dark eyes of
the girl beside him, then accepted.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Sydney. "Come along with
Hope."</p>

<p>"Be sure and see that there's enough
cooked," called the girl as he rode away.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, pard," he answered,
then, lifting his hat, waved it high
above his head as he disappeared around the
reef of rocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Hope looked after him and was still smiling
when she turned to Livingston. It may
have been something in his face that caused
her own to settle instantly into its natural
quiet.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go up there for a moment," she
said, then dismounted, and leaving her horse
walked quickly up the grassy hill until she
stood beside the grave. Some sod had been
roughly placed upon the dirt, and scattered
over that was a handful of freshly picked
wild flowers.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> picked them!" exclaimed the girl
softly, turning toward him as he came and
stood near her. "And <i>I</i> never even thought
of it! How could you think of it! I had supposed
only women thought of those things&mdash;were
expected to think of them, I mean,"
she added hastily. "You make me wonder
what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Make you wonder what?" he asked in his
quiet, well modulated voice.</p>

<p>A flush came over her face. Her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
shifted from his until they rested upon the
grave at her feet. The breeze threw a loose
strand of dark hair across one eye. She
rapidly drew her hand over her forehead, putting
it away from her vision, then looked full
and straight at the man beside her.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I cannot finish what
was in my mind to say. I forgot, Mr. Livingston,
that we are comparative strangers."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, then, that you remember it," he
replied. "It never seemed to me that we were
strangers, Miss Hathaway. I do not think so
now. There is something, I know not what,
that draws people to each other in this country.
It does not take weeks or months or years to
form a friendship here. Two people meet,
they speak, look into one another's eyes, then
they are friends, comrades&mdash;or nothing, as it
sometimes happens. They decide quickly here,
not hampered by stiff conventionalities. It is
instinct guides. Are you different from your
countrymen?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied quickly. "Not in that
one thing, at least. To be honest, I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<i>felt</i> that you were a stranger to me; but a girl,
even a rough Western girl, must sometimes
remember and be restricted by conventionalities.
I know what you are thinking, that
conventionalities include politeness, and I have
been rude to you. Perhaps that is the reason
I wouldn't let you go back to Harris' with me
the other night&mdash;I had not known you long
enough."</p>

<p>He answered her simply: "I am not thinking
of that night, but that you have just told
me you are my friend&mdash;that you think kindly
of me." She flashed him a look of surprise.</p>

<p>"But I <i>never</i> told you that!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not in just those words, true," he said.
"But it is so. Didn't you say that you had
never felt me to be a <i>stranger</i> to you? If you
had not approved of me&mdash;thought kindly of
me in the start, could you have felt so? No.
When two people meet, they are friends, or
they are still strangers&mdash;and <i>you have never
felt me to be a stranger</i>. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"I cannot deny what I have just said," she
replied. "And I will not deny that I believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
what I was saying, but your argument, though
good, doesn't down me, because I honestly
think that a person may see another person
just once, feel that he never could be a
stranger, and yet have no earthly regard or
respect for that person."</p>

<p>"Have you ever experienced that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no. You are trying to corner me; but
that isn't what I came to talk about, and it is
time to go," she said, turning away from the
grave. He walked with her down the hill
toward her horse.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you, Mr. Livingston,
about the little German girl," she said, standing
with her back against the side of her horse,
one arm around the pommel loosely holding the
reins, and the other stretched upon the glossy
back of the gentle animal. "When are you
expecting her, and what are you going to do
about her?"</p>

<p>"She should be here the last of the week.
Poor girl! My heart bleeds for her. There is
nothing to do except to tell her the sad story,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and see that she gets started safely back to her
country and her friends," he answered.</p>

<p>Hope stood upright, taking a step toward
him.</p>

<p>"You would not&mdash;oh, it would be inhuman
to send her back over the long, terrible
journey with that cruel pain in her heart!
Think how tired she will be, the thousands of
miles of travel through strange lands, and the
multitude of foreigners she will have passed!
Think of the way she has traveled, those close,
packed emigrant cars, and everything. It is
terrible!"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. She will be tired.
You are right, it would never do to send her
over that long journey so soon, though she
is not coming through as an emigrant, but
first class, for she is of good family over there.
So was Fritz&mdash;a sort of cousin, I believe, but
the poor boy got into some trouble with his
family and came over here penniless. He was
to have met her in town and they expected to
get married at once. He was going to bring
her out here to the ranch to live until he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
hunted up a location for a home. If I am
not mistaken she has some money of her own
with which they were going to buy sheep. She
has been well educated, and has had some instruction
in English, as had Fritz.</p>

<p>"I thought only of getting her back among
her friends again and I never gave a thought
about the long, weary trip and the poor, tired
girl. She must rest for a time. You have
shown me the right way, Miss Hathaway&mdash;and
yet, what am I to do? I could bring her
out here to the ranch, but there is no woman
on the place. Perhaps I may be able to secure
a man and his wife who need a situation, but
it is not likely. There may be some good family
about who would keep her for awhile. Do
you know of one?"</p>

<p>"There are several families around here
who might welcome a boarder, but none with
whom a girl of that kind could be contented,
or even comfortable. If only I were at home,
and could take her there! I <i>might</i> send her
over there. But, no, that would be worse than
anything! There is no other way," she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
suddenly, placing her hand upon his sleeve
with a quick unconscious motion. "You must
let me take care of her, up here, as I am, at
Harris'!" Excitement had flushed her cheeks
scarlet. Her eyes were filled with the light of
inspiration and more than earthly beauty.
She waited, intense, for him to speak, but he
could not. He felt her hand upon his arm,
saw the wonderful light in her face&mdash;and was
dumb.</p>

<p>"Tell me that I may take care of her. I
must&mdash;there is no other way," she insisted.
"And it will give me the privilege of doing
one little act of kindness. Say it will be all
right!"</p>

<p>"If she cannot find comfort and strength
in you, she cannot find it upon earth," he said
softly. "I have no words with which to thank
you!"</p>

<p>She took her hand from his arm with a little
sigh of content, turned around and stood at
her horse's head a moment, then mounted as
lightly and quickly as a boy.</p>

<p>"Where's your horse?" she asked, whirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the animal about until it faced him. The wonderful
light in her face had given place to a
careless, light-hearted look.</p>

<p>"Up at the stable. Have you the time and
patience to wait for me?" said Livingston.</p>

<p>"Plenty of patience, but no time," she replied.
"I promised to meet one of the twins
at six o'clock, so I've got to hurry up. I'll
meet you over at Syd's camp in a little while."</p>

<p>Before he had time to either speak or bow she
was gone. As she disappeared behind the
ledge of rocks a clear boyish whistle of some
popular air floated back to him.</p>

<p>Walking quickly through the pasture
toward the ranch buildings Edward Livingston
thought of many things&mdash;and wondered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>At six o'clock on this afternoon in
May the sun was still high above the
mountain tops. By the time Edward
Livingston reached his ranch buildings and
saddled his horse to go to Carter's camp Hope
had ridden the two miles or more between his
fence and the school-house. There she found,
idly waiting beside the isolated building, surrounded
by several gaunt staghounds, not one
of the twins, but both.</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin was all smiles, but
Dave with his back against the front of the
building was scowling sullenly, giving vent to
his ugliness by kicking small stones with the
toe of his boot and watching them as they
went sailing high into the air, then down the
sloping stretch of young green below. At one
of those stones Hope's horse shied, but the
girl smiled, knowing full well the young sav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>age's
mood. She rode rapidly, and stopped
beside the boys, but did not dismount.</p>

<p>"Am I late?" she inquired of the scowling
twin. "I see you are on time with the gun like
a good boy, Dave, and you've brought your
own along, too. We won't do a thing to those
chickens if we get sight of them to-night!"
She smiled at the boy, who became a trifle more
amiable; then she turned to his soft-voiced
twin. "How is it you're back so soon?"</p>

<p>He brushed a speck of dust from his overalls
before replying, and his voice was particularly
sweet.</p>

<p>"Had to come to report. You see when
I got there they was just quittin', so I came
along back with some o' the fellers. Didn't you
meet Long Bill and Shorty Smith up the road
there a piece when you come along?" The girl
nodded. "Well, I come back with them's far
as home; then I saw Dave getting the guns, so
I thought I'd get mine an' come along, too.
Say, what's a gating gun?" Hope looked perplexed
for an instant, then laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean a Gatling gun!" She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
laughed, then very soberly: "It's a terrible
weapon of war&mdash;a wicked thing. Why do
you ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just wanted to know," replied the
boy evasively. "I heard some o' the men
talkin' about one, so I thought I'd ask you.
Must shoot pretty fast, don't they? Long
Bill was tellin' about one that fired two thousand
shots a second."</p>

<p>"That must have been a terror of one!"
exclaimed the girl. "But they don't shoot
quite as many as that, not even in a minute,
but they are bad enough. A few of them
would simply perforate an army of men.
They're a machine gun," she went on to explain.
"Just a lot of barrels fastened in a
bunch together and turned by a crank which
feeds in the cartridges and fires them, too.
They shoot over a thousand shots a minute."</p>

<p>"I wish we'd 'a' had one the other night,"
exclaimed Dave, waking at last to a new interest
in life. "And I'd 'a' had hold of the
crank!"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it bad enough!" remonstrated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
girl. "Didn't you do enough damage to satisfy
your savage soul for awhile?"</p>

<p>"Shorty Smith's got a game leg," returned
the boy gleefully, "an' so's old Peter. Long
Bill, he's got his hand all done up in a sling,
too, an' couldn't go back on the round-up!"</p>

<p>"I wonder how Bill done that," mused the
other twin with a sweet, indrawn breath. Hope
flushed scarlet, which faded instantly, leaving
her face its rich, dark olive.</p>

<p>"Come on," she cried severely, "if we are to
get any birds to-day!"</p>

<p>"I know where there's a coyote's den," said
the soft-voiced twin. Dave was all attention
immediately.</p>

<p>"Where?" he exclaimed eagerly. Hope,
interested, too, leaned forward resting her arm
upon the pommel of the saddle.</p>

<p>"Well," said the boy, deliberately, sweetly&mdash;too
sweetly, thought the girl, who watched
him keenly&mdash;"I was goin' to keep it to myself,
an' get 'em all on the quiet, but it's in a kind
of a bad place to get at, so mebbe I can't do it
alone. It's 'bout a half mile back there, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tween
here an' home, up on that ridge behind
old Peter's shack. There's a hole under the
side of the rocks, but it's hard diggin', kind of
sandstone, I reckon. I left a pickax an' shovel
up there."</p>

<p>"Let's go up there now," cried Dave,
"an' get the whole bloomin' nest of 'em! We
can get the chickens later."</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said the other quietly.
"The find's mine. If you're in on this here
deal, you'll have to work for your share. If
you'll do the diggin' you can have half of the
bounty on 'em. How's that?"</p>

<p>Dave grunted. "Supposin' there ain't any
there," he demurred.</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin shrugged his shoulders
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"What'd you suppose <i>I'd</i> be diggin' there
for if there wasn't none? There's a whole
litter o' pups."</p>

<p>"Come on, then!" exclaimed Dave, convinced
of his good fortune, for the bounty on
coyotes was four dollars for each and every
one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Hope looked dubiously at the soft-voiced
twin, she thought of the supper at Sydney's
camp, then fired with the fun of the thing rode
gayly away with the boys.</p>

<p>The hounds leaped after them, clearing the
ground with long, easy bounds. The girl
watched them glide along, yelping, barking,
filling the air with their voices. Her horse
loped neck to neck with the soft-voiced twin's.
She pointed at the dogs, drawing the boy's attention
to them.</p>

<p>"Why did you bring them?" she asked.
"They'll warn your old ones and they'll be far
away by the time we get there. You're usually
so quick-witted, Dan, I wonder you did not
think of it!"</p>

<p>The boy made no reply, but gave her a look
filled with cunning, cool intent.</p>

<p>So this was his revenge&mdash;his twin was to dig
into a rocky ledge for an empty coyote's den!
She marveled at the boy's deliberate scheming,
and rode gayly along to see the outcome. To
this sort of revenge she had no actual objection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>They rode up over the top of a high divide,
then followed down a narrow draw until it
widened into a tiny basin, and there, in the
center of vivid green, like a smooth, well-kept
lawn, nestled old Peter's cabin. Surrounding
this pretty basin were steep, high ridges and
hills, smooth-carpeted, too, except the ever narrow
terraced "buffalo trails," and here and
there a broken line where sharp crags of sandstone
jutted out. To the base of one of these
ridges of rock, back of the old hermit's
one-roomed log shack, the soft-voiced twin
led the way, followed closely by his eager
brother.</p>

<p>The twins left their horses at the foot of the
hill and climbed up about thirty feet to a
narrow ledge, where a shovel and pickax
marked the small entrance of a coyote's den.</p>

<p>Dave set immediately at work plying the
pickax with vigor, and shoveling out the stones
and the hardened sand about the opening,
while his twin superintended the job and occasionally
offered words of encouragement.</p>

<p>Hope watched them from below. Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the soft-voiced boy was enjoying himself immensely.
He sat on one end of the ledge, his
blue-overalled legs dangling over the side,
while Dave worked industriously, hopefully
on.</p>

<p>The hounds evidently had found a trail of
some kind, for after sniffing about busily for
a moment they made a straight line along the
hill, disappearing over the high ridge. Hope
watched them out of sight, feeling an impulse
to follow, but changed her mind and rode
over to old Peter's cabin instead. The old
man limped to the door and peered out cautiously.</p>

<p>He was a squat-figured, broad-shouldered,
grizzled little man, with unkempt beard and a
shaggy sheaf of iron-gray hair, beneath which
peered bright, shifting blue eyes. He added
to his natural stoop-shouldered posture by a
rude crutch of hasty manufacture much too
short for him, which he leaned heavily upon.
He opened the door only wide enough to put
out his head, which he did cautiously, holding
his hand upon the wooden latch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"How d'!" he said in a deep, gruff voice
that seemed to come from somewhere between
his shoulders.</p>

<p>She nodded brightly, remembering to have
seen the old fellow around Harris'.</p>

<p>"You have no objection to our digging out
a den of coyotes back here, have you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Umph! There ain't no den 'round here
that I know about," he replied, still retaining
his position in the door.</p>

<p>"But see here," pointing toward the side
hill, "the boys have found one and are at work
up there right now."</p>

<p>"More fools they, then," declared old Peter,
limping cautiously outside the door. "I cleaned
out that den three year ago, an' I never knowed
a coyote to come an' live in a place that'd been
monkeyed with. Too much sense fer that. I
always said a coyote had more sense 'n them
boys! Better go tell 'em they'd as well dig fer
water on the top o' that peak, Miss!" He
shook his tousled head dubiously, watched the
boys on the hill for a moment, then limped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
back again, taking up his first position, half in,
half out the door. His attitude invited her to
be gone, but she held in her uneasy horse and
proceeded in a friendly manner to encourage
some more deep-seated, guttural tones from the
old man.</p>

<p>"Do you live here all alone?"</p>

<p>"Humph! I reckon I do."</p>

<p>"Have you lived here long?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I have."</p>

<p>"Are those your cattle up on the divide?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they be."</p>

<p>"It must be awful lonesome for you here
all by yourself. Do coyotes or wolves trouble
you much? Whoa, Rowdy!"</p>

<p>"They're a plumb nuisance, Miss. Better
kill off a few of 'em while you're here. I
reckon you kin use yer gun."</p>

<p>"I <i>reckon</i> I can, a little," she replied.</p>

<p>"When I was in the war," he continued,
"they had some sharpshooters along, but they
wan't no wimmen among 'em. I reckon you're
right handy with a gun."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" she asked suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon I know from the way you hold
that 'ere gun."</p>

<p>Just then the soft-voiced twin rode up to
the cabin. Hope accosted him.</p>

<p>"Did you get the coyotes <i>already</i>?"</p>

<p>"Nope, Dave's still diggin'. I'm goin' home
er the old man'll be huntin' me with the end of
his rope."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd better stay," she coaxed. "Think
of the fun you'll miss when Dave gets into the
den. It's your find; you ought to stay for
the finish."</p>

<p>"I'll stake you to my share," said the boy.
"He'll soon find all there is. But I guess I'd
better be a-goin'."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had," Hope replied, thoughtfully;
then she rode over to the industrious
Dave, while the soft-voiced twin wisely took a
straight bee-line across the hills to his father's
ranch.</p>

<p>This time Hope herself climbed the hill
to the spot where the boy was digging.</p>

<p>"Dave, I'm afraid there are no coyotes in
there, aren't you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped work, wiped his brow with something
that had once been a red bandanna
handkerchief, then gravely eyed the girl, who
leaned against the rocks beside him.</p>

<p>"But he said," pondering in perplexity.
"But he said&mdash;&mdash;" He looked into the ragged
entrance of the hole, then at his shovel,
then up again at the girl. "What makes you
think there ain't no coyotes there?"</p>

<p>She was filled with sympathy for the boy,
which perhaps he did not deserve, and she had
recollected the supper at Sydney's camp, and
concluded that this foolishness had gone far
enough. She coaxed the boy to leave it until
morning, but he was obdurate.</p>

<p>"No, I'm goin' to <i>know</i> if there's anything
in here er not, an' if there <i>ain't</i>&mdash;&mdash;" His
silence was ominous; then he set to work again
with renewed energy and grim determination.</p>

<p>She watched him for awhile, then walked out
to the end of the bulging sand-rocks and
climbed the grassy hill. When at length she
reached the summit, the jagged rocks below
which labored the breed boy seemed but a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in the smooth green of the mountain, while old
Peter's cabin and the setting of green carpeted
basin looked very small. On the opposite side
a fine view presented itself, showing, in all
of Nature's magnificent display, soft lines of
green ridges, broken chains of gigantic rocks,
narrow valleys traced with winding, silvery
threads of rushing water. Such a picture
would hold the attention of anyone, but this
girl of the West, of freedom and wildness, was
one with it&mdash;a part of it, and not the least
beautiful and wonderful in this lavish display
of God's handiwork.</p>

<p>She stood with bared head upon a high green
ridge. A soft, gentle chinook smoothed back
from her forehead the waving masses of dark
hair. Myriads of wild flowers surrounded her,
and from the millions below and about drifted
and mingled their combined fragrance. The
great orb of setting sun cast its parting rays
full on her face, and lingered, while the valleys
below darkened into shadow. As the last
rays lighted up her hair and departed, the yep!
yep! of the hounds attracted her attention, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
turning about with quick, alert step she moved
out of this picture&mdash;forever.</p>

<p>Standing upon a rocky ledge a hundred
feet below the summit of the ridge she
watched another scene, not the quiet picture
of Nature's benevolent hand, but a discord in
keeping, yet out of all harmony with it, in
which she blended as naturally and completely
as she had in the first. It was a race between a
little fleet-footed coyote and half a dozen
mongrel staghounds; they came toward her, a
twisting, turning streak, led by a desperate
gray animal, making, to all appearance, for
the very rocks upon which she stood. Not ten
yards behind the coyote a lank, slate-colored
hound, more gray than stag, was closing in
inch by inch. The coyote was doing nobly, so
was the mongrel hound, thought Hope, who
watched the race with breathless interest. The
yellow dogs were falling behind, losing ground
at every step, but the blue mongrel was spurting.
On they came&mdash;on&mdash;on, and the girl in
a tremor of excitement lay flat down upon the
rocks and watched them. Her heart went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to the dog. She had seen it kicked around the
yard at Harris', noticed it as it slunk about for
its scanty food, and now how nobly it was
doing! She wondered if any of her thoroughbreds
at home could do as well, and thought
not. The others were straggling far behind,
but now the blue hound was but two lengths
from the coyote, and its chances seemed small,
but on a sudden it turned and made direct for
the rocks from which the girl watched. That
instant the dog saw failure, and the light of
determination, of victory, died from its eyes.
That same instant the coyote saw salvation
from a quick end in the narrow crevices of rock
so near, and the next it lay stone dead with a
bullet through its brain. The gaunt hound
bounded over its body, then stopped short, bewildered,
and eyed its fallen foe. Then with
a savage snarl he seized it by the throat as if
to utterly demolish it, but the girl called him
off, and somehow, in his dog's heart, he understood
that the game was not his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>In the deepening shadows of the evening
Hope and the breed boy rode rapidly
toward the camp, hungry for the long-delayed
supper.</p>

<p>"Dan staked me to his share of the coyotes,
so you may have them," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Seven pups an' the old one!" exclaimed
Dave; "that's better'n huntin' chickens."</p>

<p>"And supper just now is better than anything,"
sighed Hope to herself. The boy
heard, but did not reply, his mind being busy
with a mathematical problem.</p>

<p>"How much is eight times four dollars, an'
seventy-five cents for the hide?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's a little example I'll let you work out
for yourself," replied his teacher. "You're
awfully stupid in arithmetic, Dave, and it's
too bad, for in cases of coyotes' bounty and
so forth it would be a pretty good thing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
you to know. You hurry up and figure that
out, for to-morrow you're going to get a hard
one. It's this: If a Gatling gun fires two
thousand shots a minute how many can it fire
in half an hour?"</p>

<p>"Whew! you don't expect anybody to
answer <i>that</i>, do you?" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," she laughed. "If you
can't figure it out yourself you might ask old
Peter or Long Bill, maybe they'd know."</p>

<p>The boy rode along, his thoughts absorbed
in a brown study. At length he sighed and
looked up.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, it'll be enough to buy a
horse or a new saddle with." Then as though
struck with a sudden thought he asked: "Say,
what made Dan give you his share of them
coyotes?" She suppressed a faint inclination
to smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he gave up as I did, and thought
there was nothing there. Old Peter said he
knew there wasn't. But it's just possible Dan
wanted to be generous. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Not Dan!" exclaimed the boy. "There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ain't one chance in a million <i>he'd</i> ever give such
snap as that away! I reckon," he concluded
after some studying, "he must 'a' thought that
den was empty an' was goin' to pay me back.
Ain't I got it on him now, though!"</p>

<p>"And instead of being paid back you are
getting both shares of the coyote bounty, and
you know you don't deserve it. What are you
going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"You bet <i>he</i> ain't a-goin' to get none of it!"
was the emphatic reply; to which the girl had
nothing to say.</p>

<p>In a few moments they came in sight of
Sydney's camp. From out of the small stove-pipe
of the first of the two tents rolled a volume
of smoke, and across the narrow brush-covered
valley came the delicious odor of cooking
food. Simultaneously the two riders
urged on their horses to a faster gait, for Hope
at least was hungry. It is safe to say that the
breed boy was in the same condition, and this
invitation out to supper pleased him mightily.
He was a large, stolidly built lad of fourteen
years, and like all boys of that age, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
stolidly built or slender as a sapling, was
always hungry.</p>

<p>"I'll bet I can eat the whole shootin' match,"
he declared, actually believing that he spoke
the truth.</p>

<p>"I think the meal is prepared for hungry
people," replied Hope, heartily agreeing with
the boy's sentiments. "And I hope they have
waited for us. But for goodness' sake be
careful not to make yourself sick, Dave!"</p>

<p>The camp was pitched in an open flat beside
a small sparkling mountain stream. Upon
one side of the creek was brush-covered bottom
land, through which the riders followed a
winding trail, dim in the semi-darkness. Then
they splashed across the creek, and rode up its
steep bank into the clear, grass-covered government
dooryard of the campers.</p>

<p>"Well, at last!" called a voice from the
tent. "The posse was just getting ready to go
in search of you. Thought the chickens must
have lured you away. Come right in, the feast
is prepared!"</p>

<p>"All right, Syd," called the girl happily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
dismounting almost in the arms of old Jim
McCullen, her dear "father Jim," to whom
she gave the heartiest handshake he had ever
received.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're back!" she exclaimed
as he led her horse away to stake it
out. "How's everything at home&mdash;the dogs
and horses, and everything? Never mind the
<i>people</i>! I don't want to hear a single thing
about them! We're late, Syd," she apologized,
as her cousin held open the tent flap for her to
enter, "but oh, we've had such a stack of fun!"</p>

<p>She greeted the little English cook, an old
acquaintance, who beamed with smiles as she
entered. Then she cast her dark eyes about
the tent and encountered those of Livingston.</p>

<p>"We were beginning to fear for your
safety, Miss Hathaway," he said to her, then
wondered why she should laugh. And she did
laugh loudly, with a clear, sweet, reverberant
ring that echoed through the little valley. Before
it had died away her face settled back
into its natural quiet. She threw her cowboy's
hat into a far corner, and seated herself on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
case of canned goods opposite Livingston, to
whom she immediately devoted herself.</p>

<p>She was not bold, this slender, well-built girl
of the prairies,&mdash;no one who knew her could
conceive such an idea,&mdash;but she moved with a
forwardness, a certain freedom of manner that
was her own divine right. Whatever she did,
whatever she said, appeared right in her&mdash;in
another less graceful, less charming, less magnetic,
it would in many instances seem gross
boldness. But with her wonderful, forceful
personality whatever she did or said was the
embodiment of grace and right.</p>

<p>Many of her acquaintances aped her ways
and little peculiarities of speech, to the utter
ruination of any originality or fascination
they may have themselves possessed, for such
originality cannot be imitated.</p>

<p>She leaned nearer to Livingston.</p>

<p>"You should have been with us&mdash;we've had
a great time! Just think, we got eight coyotes!
Isn't that fine for one evening?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," he exclaimed, "I think that remarkable!
Your cousin said that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of the kind was keeping you. I take it that
you are passionately fond of hunting."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the greatest sport there is in this
country, and where the hunting is good, as it
is at home along the Missouri River, there is
nothing like it. But up here there is really no
game to speak of, though the mountains at
one time abounded with it. Even chickens are
as hard to find as a needle in a haystack. We
found a den of coyotes, seven little ones, and
one of the old ones we got with the help of the
dogs. You know," she said confidentially, "I
shouldn't have delayed this supper for anything
less than a den of coyotes."</p>

<p>"There won't be the sign of any kind of
game left up here by the time she leaves,"
remarked Sydney, taking a seat on the ground
beside her.</p>

<p>"I heard tell as how she was tryin' to make
a clearance," said old Jim McCullen from the
entrance.</p>

<p>She flashed him a quick look of surprise.
He answered it with a barely perceptible
squint, which she understood from years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
comradeship to mean that he shared her secret.
It meant more than that. He not only shared
her secret, but his right hand&mdash;his life&mdash;was at
her disposal, if necessary. Then, in acknowledgment
of his silent message she gave him
one of her rare, glorious smiles.</p>

<p>"You did make a pretty lively clearing,"
said her cousin. "Eight coyotes isn't so bad.
That means numerous calves saved, young
colts, a hundred or so sheep, not to mention
innumerable wild birds and barnyard fowl."</p>

<p>"Truly, it makes us feel like conquerors,
doesn't it, Dave? But we're famished, Syd!"
Then placing her seat beside the table she
motioned the others to join her, and soon
they were enjoying a remarkably good camp
supper.</p>

<p>The cook bustled about the tent, pouring
out coffee, apologizing, praising this dish or
that, and urging them to partake of more, all
in one breath.</p>

<p>Sydney and his friend Livingston kept up
the conversation, to which Hope listened, too
contented and happy with the meal, the hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and the company to enter it herself. She
finally pushed back her plate, congratulated
the cook upon the success of his supper, and
gave the twin a warning look, which he completely
ignored.</p>

<p>"Here, take another piece o' this pie," said
the cook, who had intercepted the girl's glance.
At this invitation the boy helped himself with
alacrity, and with a broad smile the cook continued:
"I never knowed a boy yet to kill
himself eatin'. You can fill 'em plumb full to
the brim, an' in a 'alf hour they're lookin' fer
more. All the same, dog er Injun, halways
hungry; an' a boy's just the same."</p>

<p>"Eat all you want, youngster, you're not in
school now," said Carter. "I have a slight
recollection myself of a time when I had an
appetite."</p>

<p>"I failed to notice anything wrong with it
to-night, Sydney," remarked the girl.</p>

<p>"There's nothin' like a happetite," observed
the cook. "Did you's ever hear the meaning
hoff the word? This is how hit was told to
<i>me</i>." He stood before them emphasizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
each word with a forward shake of his first
finger. "H-a-p-p-y,&mdash;happy,&mdash;t-i-t-e, tight,&mdash;happy&mdash;tite&mdash;that's
right, ain't hit?
When you're heatin' hall you want you're
<i>tight</i>, an' then you're happy, ain't you? An'
that's what hit means,&mdash;happy-tight."</p>

<p>Whether this observation of the small English
cook's was original or not those present
had no way of ascertaining. But since this
was but a sample of the many observations he
aired each day, it is reasonable to suppose that
it originated in his fertile brain.</p>

<p>"I think there's no doubt about that
being the true derivation of the word," said
Hope. "In fact, I am sure it is. Isn't it,
Dave?"</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' about it," said the
boy, looking up from his last bite of pie; then
giving a deep sigh he reluctantly moved away
from the table.</p>

<p>"Well, I can guarantee that you're happy,"
said Hope, "and that is a positive demonstration
of the truth of William's observation.
But now we must go," she said, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
abruptly and picking up her hat from the
corner of the tent.</p>

<p>"You haven't been here a half hour yet,
Hopie, but I suppose I must be thankful for
small favors," deplored Carter.</p>

<p>"I've had my supper,&mdash;a nice one, too,&mdash;and
that's what I came for, Syd, dear," said
the girl. "And if I may, I will come again,
until you and dear old Jim both get tired
of me."</p>

<p>"<i>Get tired</i>&mdash;fiddlesticks!" exclaimed McCullen,
while Sydney laughed a little, and left
the tent to saddle her horse. The breed boy
followed him; then Livingston, too, was about
to leave when McCullen stopped him.</p>

<p>"Just stay in here by the fire and talk to
Hopie till we get your horses," he said,
abruptly leaving them together.</p>

<p>The girl drew nearer the stove.</p>

<p>"It's quite chilly out this evening," she
remarked.</p>

<p>"That is the beauty of the nights in this
northern country," he replied, coming near to
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, we're alone," she observed. "I
wonder where William went!"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice his disappearance," he
replied. "But we are alone&mdash;together. Are
you not frightened?"</p>

<p>"Frightened? No!" she said softly.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"A senseless remark. Do not notice it&mdash;or
anything, I beg of you. I am quite too happy
to weigh my words."</p>

<p>"Then you have proved the cook's theory
correct; providing you have eaten&mdash;sufficiently,"
she replied. They both smiled, and
darts of light from the stove played about
their faces.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me&mdash;this night&mdash;to ride
home with you?" he asked, watching the fantastic
shadows upon her face and catching
gleams of her deep eyes as they occasionally
sought his own.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment before replying.</p>

<p>"You think me a strange girl," she said.
"I wonder what you will think of me now if I
refuse this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think nothing except that you are the
sweetest girl I have ever known&mdash;and the
<i>noblest</i>. I thank my Maker for having met
you, and spoken with you, and sat here in the
firelight beside you! Your ways are your
own. I shall not&mdash;cannot question you, or
impose myself upon you. Our lives, it seems,
lie far apart. But I cannot help it&mdash;the
words burn themselves out&mdash;I love you, <i>Hope</i>&mdash;I
love you! Forgive me!" He raised her
hand to his lips and left her standing alone
in the firelight.</p>

<p>"He loves me," she thought, far into the
quiet hours of the night. "He loves me, and
yet he ran away from me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>Late one afternoon during the following
week Livingston drove up to
Harris' ranch and helped from his
buggy a small, fair-haired girl who looked
with wonderment at the squalid log buildings,
the squealing, scurrying pigs and children,
and the usual group of roughly dressed men
waiting for their supper. The pain in her
eyes deepened, and she clasped Livingston's
arm like a frightened child.</p>

<p>"<i>O</i>, <i>mein Freund</i>, I fear!" she cried, drawing
back.</p>

<p>"Come," he urged gently. "There is
nothing to fear. You must trust me, for I am
indeed your friend, little girl. We will find
the one who is expecting you&mdash;who will love
you and be a sister to you."</p>

<p>A look of trustful obedience came into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sweet blue eyes, now disfigured by much
weeping, and without hesitation she walked
beside him past the group of rough-looking
men, dirty, barefooted children, scurrying pigs
and dogs, to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>An Indian woman with a baby in her arms
stood in the shadow of the room and motioned
them to enter.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Hathaway here?" inquired Livingston.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the door of an
inner room opened and Hope, her slender
form gowned as he had first seen her, came
quickly across the untidy room toward
them.</p>

<p>"I am Hope," she said to the girl, taking
both of her soft little hands in her own and
looking in wonder at the childish face with its
setting of wavy gold hair. Suddenly the
broken-hearted girl was in her arms sobbing
out her grief upon her shoulder. Hope led
her to a seat, removed her hat and coat, and
uttered words of endearment to her, soothing
her as she would have done a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Could this impulsive, loving girl be Hope,
wondered Livingston, who still stood in the
doorway. She smoothed back the bright hair
from the pretty, childish face, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are! And what a little
thing to have such a grief! Oh, it is cruel,
<i>cruel</i>! Cry, dear, cry all you want to&mdash;it will
do you good, and the pain will sooner be
gone."</p>

<p>"<i>O, Gott im Himmel</i>," sobbed the German
girl, "<i>gieb mir Muth es zu ertragen!</i>"</p>

<p>"But you are, oh, so much braver than I.
Look at me, see what a great, big strong thing
I am, and <i>I</i> moaned and cried because the
world wasn't made to my liking! Oh, it makes
me <i>ashamed</i> now, when I see such a little, frail
thing as you suffer such a real sorrow! But I
am your friend&mdash;your sister, if you will have
me."</p>

<p>"How goot you are, <i>meine liebe Freundin</i>!"
sobbed the girl.</p>

<p>"May you never have reason to change
your opinion," replied Hope slowly, in German.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"She speaks my language!" exclaimed the
German girl, with something like hopefulness
in her voice.</p>

<p>"But very poorly," apologized Hope, looking
for the first time at the man standing
quietly in the doorway.</p>

<p>"It will comfort her that you speak it at
all," he replied. "But without any language
you would still be a comfort to her. I will
leave her in your hands, Miss Hathaway. She
has had a long journey and&mdash;must be very
tired." He bowed and turned to go, but,
recollecting something, came back into the
room. "I am going now," he said to the
German girl, "but I will come to see you
often. You need have no fear when you are
with&mdash;Hope."</p>

<p>Hope turned to him impulsively.</p>

<p>"You will do as you say," she begged.
"You will come often to see her." Then
added, "You know she'll be terribly lonely
at first!"</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure, if I may,"
he replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>She held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"If you <i>may</i>! Are you not master of your
own actions? Good-by!"</p>

<p>She took her hand from his firm clasp with
something like a jerk, and found herself blushing
furiously as she turned to the little German
girl.</p>

<p>As far as anyone could be made comfortable
in the Harris home Hope made her little
charge so. She shared her room, her bed
with her, took her to school each day and kept
her constantly at her side.</p>

<p>She was a simple, trusting German girl,
bright, and extremely pretty, and her name
was Louisa Schulte. From the first she had
loved Hope with an affection that was as
touching as it was beautiful, and as she came
to know her better, day by day her love and
admiration grew akin to worship. She believed
her to be the most wonderful girl that
ever lived, in some respects fairly superhuman.
She marveled at the skill with which she could
ride and shoot, and her wisdom in Western
lore. And behind every accomplishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
every word and act, Louisa read her heart,
which no one before had ever known.</p>

<p>So finding in the bereaved girl, who had so
strangely come into her life, the sympathy
and love for which she had vainly searched in
one of her own sex, Hope gave her in return
the true wealth of a sister's heart.</p>

<p>For some time after Louisa's arrival Hope
was with her almost constantly, but the inactive
life began to tell upon her. Her eyes
would light up with an involuntary longing at
the sight of the breed boys racing over the
hills upon their ponies.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go?" asked the German
girl, one morning, reading her friend with observant
eyes as the boys started out for a
holiday.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful warm Saturday morning.
The two girls were sitting on a pile of logs
by the side of the road sunning themselves,
far enough away from the Harris house and
its surroundings to enjoy the beauty of a perfect
day.</p>

<p>"I would rather stay here with you," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>plied
Hope, arranging a waving lock which
the wind had displaced from Louisa's golden
tresses. "When the horse comes that I have
sent for, and you have learned to ride better,
we will go all over these mountains together.
I will show you Sydney's camp and take you
to old Peter's cabin, and let you see where
we found the den of coyotes. We will go
everywhere then, and have such a good
time!"</p>

<p>Louisa looked at her tenderly, but her eyes
were filled with the pain of a great sorrow.</p>

<p>"O, <i>Fräulein</i>, you are goot, so goot to me!
If I may ask, not too much, I wish to see
where lies <i>mein lieber Fritz</i>. I vill weep no
more&mdash;then. Ven I sleep the dreams come so
much. If I could see once the place it would
be better, <i>nicht wahr</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hope, "it is a lovely spot
and you shall see it. Mr. Livingston could
not have found a more beautiful place. Just
now it is all a mass of flowers and green grass
as far as you can see, and behind it is a great
high jagged wall of stone. It is beautiful!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Livingston is a good, true man,"
mused Louisa, lapsing into German, which
Hope followed with some difficulty. "He
was very kind to my poor Fritz, who loved
him dearly. His letters were filled with his
praises. It was of him, of the beautiful country,
and our love of which he always wrote.
He was a good boy, <i>Fräulein</i>."</p>

<p>"Tell me about him," said Hope, adding
hastily, "if you feel like it. I would love to
hear."</p>

<p>Hope could not have suggested a wiser
course, for to speak of a grief or trouble wears
off its sharp edges.</p>

<p>"He was a good boy," replied Louisa. "I
cannot see why God has taken him from this
beautiful place, and from me. It has been
a year, now, since I last saw him. He left in
a hurry. He had never spoken of love until
that day, nor until he told me of it did I
know that it was real love I had so long felt
for him. We grew up together. He was my
cousin. I had other cousins, but he was ever
my best companion&mdash;my first thought. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
came to me that day and said: 'Louisa, I am
going far away from here to the free America.
It breaks my heart to leave you. Will
you promise to some day join me there and
be my wife?' I promised him, and then cried
much because he was going so far. It was
even worse than the army, I thought, and
somehow it held a strange dread for me. But
Fritz would not think of the army. His eldest
brother returned, and as head of the family all
the money went to him. My aunt married
again. Her husband is a wholesale merchant
of wines. He gave Fritz a position in his
warehouse, but very soon they quarreled. He
seemed not to like Fritz. Then there was
nothing for the poor boy but the army, or far
America. I could not blame him when he
chose freedom. The lot of the youngest son
is not always a happy one. A friend who had
been here told all about this great country and
the good opportunities, so he came. His letters
were so beautiful! I used to read them
over and over until the paper was worn and
would break in pieces. For a whole year I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
waited, and planned, and lived on the letters
and my dreams, then filled with happiness I
started to him. To think that I have come
to the end of this long, strange journey to a
foreign land to see but his grave! Oh, God in
heaven, help me be brave!"</p>

<p>"There is no death," said Hope, rising
abruptly from the log upon which she had
been sitting and standing erect before Louisa,
her dark commanding eyes forcing the attention
of the grief-stricken girl. "I know there
is no death. I feel it with every throb of my
pulse&mdash;in every atom of my being! <i>I</i> and my
<i>body</i>!&mdash;<i>I</i> and my <i>body</i>!" she continued impressively.
"How distinct the two! Can the
death of this lump of clay change the <i>I</i> that is
really myself? Can anything exterminate
the living me? Every throb of my whole
being tells me that I am more than this perishable
flesh&mdash;that I am more than time or place
or condition or <i>death</i>! I believe, like the
Indians, that when we are freed from this
husk of death&mdash;this perishing flesh, that the
we, as we truly are, is like a prisoner turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
loose&mdash;that then, only do we realize what <i>life</i>
really means."</p>

<p>Louisa's innocent eyes were intent upon her
as she strove to grasp the full meaning of the
English words.</p>

<p>"<i>Ich weiss; es ist wahr</i>," she replied softly,
"<i>aber wenn der Kummer so frisch ist, dann ist
es unmöglich in dem Gedanken Trost zu
finden</i>."</p>

<p>"I should have said nothing," said Hope in
contrition, seating herself upon the log pile
again.</p>

<p>"<i>Nein</i>, my dear, dear friend! I have now
dis misery, but I belief you. Somedimes
your vords vill help&mdash;vat you calls 'em&mdash;vill
<i>soothe</i>, und I vill be better."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," said Hope, jumping
from the logs and giving her hand to Louisa
to assist her down. "Let's walk a little."</p>

<p>They went slowly up the road toward the
school-house, and had not proceeded far when
they met Livingston driving toward them in
an open buggy.</p>

<p>Hope waved her hand to him and hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
forward, while Louisa smiled upon him the
faintest of dimpled greetings, then drew
back to the side of the road while the girl
of the prairies stepped up to the side of his
buggy.</p>

<p>"You haven't kept your word very well,"
she said. "We have seen you only twice, and
Louisa has wondered many times what has
been keeping you. Isn't that so, Louisa?"
she nodded at the girl. "I am glad you have
come this morning, because I want to ask you
a favor."</p>

<p>"I am at your service," he replied.</p>

<p>"You know Louisa hasn't learned to ride
yet, and Harris' have no other way of conveyance,
so I wanted to ask you to take
her in your buggy&mdash;to see Fritz's grave."
The last few words were added below her
breath.</p>

<p>"I came this morning to ask you if she did
not wish to see it," he replied. "It might be
good for her."</p>

<p>"Of course <i>you</i> should be the first one to
think of it!" she said quickly, shading her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
with her hand to look down the long, crooked
stretch of road. "I didn't think of it at all
myself. She has just asked me if she might
see it. All the virtues are yours by right," she
continued, showing, as she again faced him, a
flash of her strong white teeth. "And the
funny part of it is, I think I am getting jealous
of the very virtues you possess!"</p>

<p>"You should see with my eyes awhile," he
replied, "and you would have no cause for
jealousy."</p>

<p>"I do not know jealousy in the ordinary
sense of the word&mdash;that was entirely left out
of my make-up, but for once I covet the attributes
of thoughtfulness that should be ingrained
in every woman's nature."</p>

<p>When she had spoken he seemed struggling
for an instant with some strong emotion.
Without replying he stepped from his buggy
and walked to the heads of his horses, presumably
to arrange some part of the harness.</p>

<p>Livingston struggled to keep back the
words which sprang to his lips. He loved the
girl with all the strength of his nature. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
whole attitude toward him artlessly invited
him to speak, but his manhood forbade it.</p>

<p>He was a puzzle, she thought, impatiently.
Why did he not make a little effort to woo her,
after having declared his love in no uncertain
manner? She was not sure that she wanted
to receive his advances if he should make any,
but why did he not make them? She knew
that she was interested in him, and she knew,
also, that she was piqued by his apparent indifference.
She knew he was like a smoldering
volcano, and she had all a girl's curiosity
to see it burst forth; but with the thought
came a regret that their acquaintance would
then be at an end.</p>

<p>"I can take you both up there now, if you
wish," he said, coming around to the side of
the buggy. "The seat is wide and I do not
think you will be uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Hope had turned her eyes once more down
the narrow, winding stretch of gray toward
the Harris ranch.</p>

<p>"I think I will not go," she replied, still
peering ahead from under the shade of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
hand. "Yes, I am sure now that's Sydney.
See, just going into the corral. Jim was to
have brought me an extra saddle horse to-day,
but Sydney has come instead, so I'll go back.
Louisa can go alone with you." She motioned
to the girl. "Come, Louisa, Mr. Livingston
wants to take you for a little drive. I will be
down there at the house when you come back."</p>

<p>The girl understood enough of their conversation
to know where she was expected to
go. Obediently, trustfully, with one loving
glance at Hope, she climbed into the buggy
beside Livingston and was soon riding rapidly
up the mountain road to the grave of her
sweetheart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Hope's anxiety to reach the ranch
could not have been great, for she
walked slowly along the dark, gray
stretch of road, vaguely dreaming the while,
and offering excuses to herself for not having
accepted Livingston's invitation. She managed
to find several reasons. First, it would
have been too crowded; second, Sydney had
brought the horse, and was probably waiting
to see her; third, she had no particular desire
to go, because he had so obviously wanted her
to do so. Finally, after weighing all her excuses,
she was obliged to admit that the only
thing that really troubled her was Livingston's
evident unconcern at her refusal to accompany
them.</p>

<p>She had reached a point in her life where
self-analysis was fast becoming an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
study. At present it struck her as being amusing.</p>

<p>The clatter of hoofs and a wild whoop
brought her out of her absorbing study, as
down the nearest side-hill the twins raced pell-mell,
the pinto pony leading the stylish Dude
by half a length. They drew up suddenly in
the road beside her.</p>

<p>"Now you can see fer yourself that that
Dude cayuse of Dave's ain't in it with my
pinto!" exclaimed the soft-voiced twin.</p>

<p>"What'er you givin' us!" shouted Dave.
"Just hear him brag about that spotted cayuse
of his'n! 'Twasn't no even race at all.
He had 'bout a mile the start!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come off your perch!" retorted the
other sweetly.</p>

<p>"Where are you boys going?" asked Hope.</p>

<p>"Nowheres. We seen you from the top of
the divide, an' I thought I'd just show you
what was in Pinto. He's all right&mdash;you bet!
Ain't you, old man?" said the boy, pulling his
pony's mane affectionately.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> wasn't tryin' to show off!" ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>claimed
Dave. "But just give me a level road
an' I'll beat you all to pieces!"</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" inquired Hope.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in a sheepish
manner.</p>

<p>"I'm going to guess," said the girl suspiciously,
"and if I am right you'll have to own
up. In the first place your father sent you out
to bring in those cows and calves over near old
Peter's basin. Instead of that you went on
farther and found a camp. You went in one
of the tents and ate some dried blackberry
pie, instead of bringing in the cattle. Now,
isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Dave looked dumfounded.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you knew that when you
wasn't along! Gee, you must know things
like grandmother White Blanket!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin began to laugh. "I
told you that you was gettin' more o' that pie
on your face 'n you was in your mouth!" he
exclaimed, whereupon the other quickly turned
away his besmeared countenance, proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
to wipe it vigorously with the sleeve of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Have you got your bounty yet for the
coyotes you dug out of the hill?" asked Hope,
to allay his discomfort. She glanced sideways
at the soft-voiced twin, who assumed his
most docile, innocent expression, and rode on
ahead. It had become a sore subject with him.
Suddenly giving a wild whoop he spurred up
his pinto and dashed in among the assortment
of tents, bringing to the entrance of her abode
old Mother White Blanket, who hurled
after him numerous blood-curdling, Indian invectives.
Then she covered her yellow prongs
of teeth under a wrinkled lip and scowled
fiercely at Hope as she passed along the road,
causing the breed boy to say:</p>

<p>"The old woman's got it in fer you, I
reckon. But don't you care, she ain't so all-fired
smart as she makes out to be!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of her," replied Hope.
"She suspects me of having had a hand in the
shooting that night at the sheep-corrals up
there, and in consequence has a very bad heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
for me. Now how could she think such a thing
as that? I don't believe she's much of a witch,
though, because when she gets in one of her
fits of passion she'd ride off on a broomstick if
she were."</p>

<p>"She's got eyes like a hawk," said the boy,
"always seem' everything that's goin' on."</p>

<p>"She don't miss much, that's sure," mused
Hope, as they passed by the house and approached
the corrals. There the soft-voiced
twin was talking with Carter, praising, enthusiastically,
the points of his pinto cayuse,
and comparing it with the blooded saddle
horse which Sydney had just brought from
Hathaway's home-ranch at Hope's request.
The boy never knew just how his statements
were received, for at sight of Hope the young
man went out into the road to meet her.</p>

<p>She welcomed him with a quick smile, which
a year previous would have been accompanied
by a sisterly kiss. Carter noted its omission
this day with singular impatience. How long,
he wondered, before she would forget his foolishness.
It occurred to him then, that in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of her girlishness she was very much a woman,
and his actions toward her, which now he most
heartily regretted, had ignited a spark of self-consciousness
in her nature, raising an effective
barrier between them that only time could
wear away.</p>

<p>"I expected Jim with the horse instead of
you, Sydney," she said. "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"A lot of men are up with the trail herds,
and your father needed Jim to help pay them
off, so I brought the horse instead. Jim will
be back in a couple of days," he explained.</p>

<p>"You went down to the ranch, then, with
him yesterday evening, I suppose," said Hope.
"What are they all doing there?"</p>

<p>"It looks just as it did any evening last
summer, if you happened to drop in on them.
Little Freddie Rosehill thumping away at the
piano and singing bass from the soles of his
feet, that tallest Cresmond girl, with the red
hair, yelling falsetto, and the others joining in
when they got the chance. Then down at the
other end of the room the usual card table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>&mdash;your
father, mother, Clarice, and O'Hara, and
father and mother Cresmond watching the
game and listening to the warbling of their
offspring."</p>

<p>"Is <i>Larry O'Hara</i> there?" asked Hope in
surprise. "I thought he was not coming this
year."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever think O'Hara is going to
give you up as easy as that," replied Sydney,
laughing. "He just got there yesterday, and
was in the depths of despair when he discovered
you had flown. He told Clarice he
was coming over here to see you as soon as he
could decently get away. His mother's with
him, which makes that proposition a little more
awkward for him than if he were alone. It
was late when I got there and I didn't have
time to change my clothes, so I just walked in
on them in this outfit. But they seemed pretty
glad to see me."</p>

<p>"I'll bet they nearly smothered you with
welcome! I can just see them," said Hope.
"That Lily Cresmond with the red hair always
was so demonstrative to you, Syd. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
sorry O'Hara is there, and Clarice Van Renssalaer,
too&mdash;or rather, I mean, I'm sorry only
because they are there that I am not at home,
for I like them; but I'm not very sorry
either, Syd. I'd rather be up here in the
mountains, free like this, with my poor little
Louisa, and you and Jim camping over the
hills there, than stifling in the atmosphere of
those New York people."</p>

<p>"You're a queer girl, Hope, but I don't believe
I blame you much. I was glad to leave
this morning and head my horse this way."</p>

<p>"Did father&mdash;ask about me?" she inquired
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"He didn't lose any time in getting me off
alone and questioning me for about an hour,"
he replied. "He misses you, Hope."</p>

<p>"Poor father&mdash;poor old Dad!" exclaimed
the girl softly. Then with a peculiar motion
of her head and shoulders, as if throwing off
a load, she remarked firmly: "But that makes
no difference. I am glad, anyway, to be here.
I have you and Jim so near, and my dear little
German girl&mdash;and perfect freedom!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you have Livingston to take the place
of O'Hara," he returned, "and there is
nothing lacking, as far as I can see, except a
good cook in the Harris family."</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingston is nothing to me," replied
Hope quickly, "and he doesn't care anything
for me, if that is what you mean to imply."
Her eyes flashed and she spoke with unusual
sharpness.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to quarrel, Hope," exclaimed
Carter. Then, putting his hand upon
her shoulder, said very earnestly: "I was just
joking, and didn't mean to imply anything, so
don't be angry with me. Besides, it won't do.
It's near noon and I was going to suggest that
we go over to camp and have William get us
up a good dinner, and then we'll go fishing.
What do you say? You can invite your breed
brigade; they look hungry," pointing to the
two boys sitting on the ground in the shade of
a log barn, their knees drawn up under their
chins.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind what you say, Syd,
dear," she said abruptly. "I believe I am get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>ting
to be quite as foolish as other people, to
be offended so easily. I should as soon expect
you to turn upon me in wrath if I told you to
look out for little Louisa."</p>

<p>"Poor little Louisa," he exclaimed.
"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"We went up the road for a walk, and Mr.
Livingston drove along and took her up to
see her Fritz's grave," she explained.</p>

<p>"Now then, my girl, <i>you</i> look out for
Louisa! There's nothing like consoling grief
to bring two hearts close together. How did
you ever come to allow him to carry her away
up there and do the consolation act? You'll
sure lose him now! I thought you had more
diplomacy!"</p>

<p>She laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Unless a man loved me with every atom of
his being, with his whole life, I couldn't feel
the least attraction for him in <i>that</i> way," she
said. "That is the way I have planned for the
<i>one</i> man to love, my ideal man, Syd. When
such a man comes along I shall love him, but I
very much fear he does not exist."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you're doomed to die an old maid,
Hope! But don't you think O'Hara entertains
that kind of affection for you?"</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have a perfect horror of
being an old maid. Probably I'll outgrow it.
O'Hara? No, indeed! He'll get over it soon
enough, and think just as much of some other
girl. He's a nice boy, a good friend, but he
isn't just my idea of what a man should be."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're doomed, Hope," said
her cousin, shaking his head solemnly.
"What will you do, spend your lonely maidenhood
out here on the prairie, or take a life
interest in some Old Ladies' Home?"</p>

<p>"Did you say something about going up to
camp?" she asked. "But I ought to wait for
Louisa; she should be back now."</p>

<p>"I've ridden twenty miles this morning, and
the consequence is my appetite is rather annoying,"
replied Sydney. He called to the
two boys, sitting drowsily in the shade.
"Here, you boys, if you want to go out and
get some grub with this lady, just run in her
horse for her as fast as you can."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I should say so!" exclaimed the soft-voiced
twin, who jumped up with wonderful
alacrity, followed more slowly by Dave.
Another moment they were spurring their
ponies across the large, fenced pasture toward
a bunch of horses grazing quietly in the distance.</p>

<p>"Those boys are all right when there's anything
to eat in sight," remarked Carter.</p>

<p>"Or any fun," added the girl.</p>

<p>"How in the world do you tell them apart?"
he inquired. "I look at one and think I've
got him spotted for sure, and then when the
other one turns up I'm all mixed again. You
seem to know them so well, you must have
some kind of a mark to go by."</p>

<p>"They are so entirely different in their natures,"
she said, "that I almost know them
apart without looking at them. Their faces
look different to me, too. Dan has certain expressions
that Dave never had; and their
voices are nothing alike."</p>

<p>"I've noticed their voices," said her cousin,
watching the boys as they deftly turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
bunch of horses and headed them toward the
corral. "Well, they can sure ride to beat three
of a kind! They're not losing any time with
those horses, either."</p>

<p>The corral was built in a corner of the pasture
fence, near the stables. It took the breed
boys scarcely five minutes to corral the horses,
rope the saddle animal wanted, throw open the
large gate and lead out the horse. The other
horses followed with a mad dash, kicking up
their heels in very joy for their unexpected
freedom.</p>

<p>Hope watched the road, as far as she could
see it, looking for the return of her small German
friend.</p>

<p>"We'll ride along," suggested Sydney,
throwing the saddle upon her horse, "and
we'll probably meet them. I don't think we'll
have any trouble getting Livingston to drive
over to camp, and we'll all go fishing together."</p>

<p>This seemed to take a load from the mind of
Hope, and light-heartedly she rode away toward
the camp with her cousin and the breed
boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>They met Livingston and his charge
just as they reached the dimly marked
trail that led up a gulch toward
Sydney's camp. At the invitation extended
for dinner the sheep-man drove up the coulee
and followed the riders.</p>

<p>William, the cook, greeted his guests with
a generous smile, then proceeded to do a great
amount of hustling about preparing for the
meal, which he promised would be an excellent
one. Being a round-up cook of much experience,
he soon set before them such an assortment
of edibles as would have dumfounded
the uninitiated.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed off pleasantly. Hope
was unusually vivacious, and Sydney full of
amusing small talk, principally concerning
his sundry adventures and impressions during
his brief absence from camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>They all felt the grief of the German girl,
and each showed his sympathy in a different
manner. Sydney talked, often in an aimless,
senseless way, but obviously to divert the unhappy
girl. Hope filled each pause, concluded
every description with rich drollery and mimicry,
while Livingston's quiet attentiveness
betokened the deepest compassion. Even William
gave her many smiles and made numerous
witty remarks, which were wholly lost upon
her.</p>

<p>"You're in a very bad crowd of people,
Miss Louisa," said Sydney. "But after
awhile you'll be so much like us that you won't
notice how bad we are!"</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Sydney!" exclaimed
Hope. "Louisa never could be bad!" Then
to the girl: "The truth is, <i>he's</i> the only bad
one in the whole outfit, so don't let him make
you think that the rest of us are bad, too!"</p>

<p>"You are all <i>so</i> goot," said Louisa, in great
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Now listen to that!" cried Sydney.
"That's the first time anybody ever accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<i>me</i> of being good! I'll get a gold medal and
hang it about your neck, Miss Louisa, and I'll
be your faithful servant from now on."</p>

<p>"And you'll bring her fresh flowers every
day, and maybe you could borrow Mr. Livingston's
buggy since you haven't one of your
own. But don't soar too high, Sydney, she
doesn't know you yet!" returned his cousin.</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> like him," said Louisa, "and daat
iss&mdash;vat you calls 'em&mdash;<i>recommend</i> enough!"</p>

<p>They were all surprised by this first flash
of the real Louisa, the Louisa of sunshine and
mirth, whom Sorrow had so soon branded.</p>

<p>It was the first time Sydney had heard her
utter anything but the briefest monosyllables.
He looked at her, astonished. For an instant
silence reigned, then Hope, with sudden
abandonment, threw her arms about her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, you're the dearest thing I ever saw!
Isn't she, Syd?" And then, as if ashamed of
her impulsiveness, she jumped up and laughingly
left the tent. A few moments later she
put her head inside, remarking: "The trout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
haven't begun to feed yet. I'd like to know
how we are going to put in the time waiting
for them! It's too hot for anything in
there, and it won't be a bit of use to try to
fish for an hour, at least. All of you come
outside."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carter, rising lazily to his feet.
"I've discovered a small Eden down there under
the willows, along the creek. All green
and mossy and pepperminty, but the snake's
never showed up yet. Come on, we'll all go
down there."</p>

<p>He led the way along the steep bank of the
small creek and down its opposite side until a
parting in the willow brush revealed one of
Nature's hidden glories, a small glen, shady
and beautiful. From its very center sprang a
tiny spring, forming a clear, glassy pool of
water which narrowed into a tiny trickling rill
that went creeping through the grass-carpeted
arbor to the larger stream beyond.</p>

<p>It was beautifully inviting, and Hope sank
down upon a mossy cushion with an exclamation
of delight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, how am I for an entertainer?"
asked Sydney gayly. Hope turned her dark
eyes upon him, then about the little arbor.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said softly, "don't talk for a
minute&mdash;don't even breathe. This is glorious!"
Then after a brief pause, continued:
"There, the spell's passed! This place is no
longer enchanting, but lovely and cool, just the
same, and is a whole lot better than that roasting
tent up there. What became of the twins?
Probably they are more attracted by William's
mode of entertainment than yours,
Syd!" She turned to Livingston and smiled.
"William has two regular customers already,
you know. I am afraid to think what will
happen if he camps here all summer."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to add my name to the list
if he entertains such charming ones every
day," replied the sheep-man.</p>

<p>"I meant the <i>boys</i>," said Hope in all seriousness.</p>

<p>Sydney laughed outright.</p>

<p>"How do you know but what he meant the
boys, too?" he asked. She looked at him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
an assumption of surprise. "A girl never
makes such a mistake as that," she said. "It
was a very pretty compliment."</p>

<p>"Worthy of O'Hara," he put in.</p>

<p>"Worthy of Mr. Livingston," she declared.
"O'Hara's compliments are not so delicate.
They are beautifully worded, but unconvincing."</p>

<p>"I believe she's actually giving you credit
for extreme honesty!" exclaimed Carter.</p>

<p>"I sincerely trust so," replied his friend
heartily. "It would be a most pleasing compliment."</p>

<p>"Well, I should say it would be the biggest
one <i>she</i> ever paid anyone! You're the first
one Hope ever credited with honesty. You
can sit for an hour and tell her a great long
story and she'll never give you the satisfaction
of knowing for sure whether she believes you
or not. The chances are she don't. She'll take
your assertions, weigh every word, and then
draw her own conclusions."</p>

<p>"You only know from your own experience,"
demurred Hope. "All people haven't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
your habit of departing from the truth, you
know." Then to Livingston: "Really, he
can tell a terrible whopper with the straightest
face imaginable! He only proves to you how
well I know him. Last summer he told a girl
a ridiculous story about snakes. It was her
first visit at the ranch, and for several days
I thought something was the matter with her
brain. Every time she heard a grasshopper
buzz anywhere near she would give a shriek
and turn deathly pale. She finally told me
that she feared rattlesnakes because Sydney
had told her that that particular buzz was the
snake's death rattle and that something or
somebody was doomed for sure, that if the
snake couldn't get the human victim it had set
its eyes upon, it crept into a prairie-dog hole
and got one of them. Of course that is only a
sample of his very foolish yarns, which no one
but an ignorant person would think of believing."</p>

<p>"I remember," laughed Sydney. "That
was that fair Lily Cresmond. She got up
and had breakfast with me at six o'clock this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
morning. Poor girl! I'm afraid I've put my
foot in it this time!"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, did she propose to
you?" asked Hope, aghast.</p>

<p>"Not that I'm aware of!" answered Sydney.
"No, it's worse than that. She asked
me to tell her really and truly why <i>you</i> weren't
at home this summer. She crossed her heart,
hoped to die she'd never breathe a word of it
to a living, human creature, so I told her that
it pained me to tell the sad story, but last
season Freddie Rosehill had shown you such
evident admiration that your father had become
thoroughly alarmed and thought it best
to keep you out of his way for the present.
But I suggested that you might face paternal
wrath and come back just for one look at the
dear little boy."</p>

<p>"Sydney, you never did!" gasped Hope.
"<i>How could you?</i>"</p>

<p>"Freddie came trotting out for his morning
constitutional just as I was riding away," he
continued, "and he waved his cane in the air
and actually <i>ran</i> down to the corral to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
good-by. I really believe he liked me for once
because I was leaving, and he very gingerly
asked about you, and naturally was visibly relieved
when I assured him that you would
probably not be home while he was there.
Talk about your joshers!" he said to Livingston.
"Hope had the little Englishman so he
didn't know his soul was his own! She'd take
him out on the prairie and lose him, have him
pop away for an hour at a stuffed chicken tied
to the top of a tree, shoot bullets through his
hat by mistake, and about a million other
things too blood-curdling to mention. He
didn't want to refuse my aunt's invitation to
join the party at the ranch every summer, but
his days and nights were spent in mortal terror
of this dignified daughter of the house. And
I must say there wasn't much love lost between
them."</p>

<p>"A brainless little fop!" commented Hope.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems he had sense enough to
catch that oldest Cresmond girl, Lily, whose
ears I filled with the pathetic story; but I didn't
know it then, that's the fun of it! He held out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
his fat little hand to me when I started out
this morning and said: 'I want your congratulations.
Lily has promised to be my Lady.'
'You don't say so,' I said. 'Lord, but what a
haul you've made, Rosehill!' 'Yes,' said he,
'she's a beauty!' 'And a million or so from
her papa'll set you up in housekeeping in great
shape over in Old England. I certainly congratulate
you!' said I. He didn't seem to have
anything more to say, so I rode off, and do you
know I never once thought of what I'd told
that girl about him liking you until I was
halfway here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Syd, what have you done!" cried
Hope. "You ought to go right back to the
ranch and fix it up for them. It might be real
serious!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry; they'll fix it up between
them, just give 'em time," laughed Sydney.
"But then I shouldn't like to be the cause of
breaking up such a match. I sure wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"I should say not! It would be terrible!"
agreed Hope.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't like it on my conscience,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
continued Sydney, "to break up such a good
match by my thoughtless words. It would be
too bad to spoil two families!"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, excepting the lady,
whom I do not know," remarked Livingston.
"But I have met Rosehill. He is, in my estimation,
a worthless specimen of English aristocracy."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're mostly all alike, a mighty poor
outfit all through, from the ones I've known!
But I guess they'll manage to fix it up among
themselves," laughed Hope.</p>

<p>At this remark Livingston looked oddly at
the girl, then the brush crackled near them,
followed by the appearance of one of the
twins, who, smiling victoriously, held up for
inspection a small string of trout.</p>

<p>"And here we've been wasting our time
when we might have been fishing instead!"
exclaimed Hope, springing up from her
mossy couch and minutely examining the
string of fish.</p>

<p>"You'll find fishing tackle, all you want, up
at camp. William'll show you," remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Sydney. "For my part I shall stay here and
gather strawberry leaves for Miss Louisa to
make into wreaths. Isn't this one a daisy?
It's too warm to fish, anyway," he concluded.</p>

<p>"You shall not decide for her, Syd," declared
Hope. "Which would you rather do,
Louisa?"</p>

<p>The German girl shook her head, smiling
a little. "It is very warm," she said.</p>

<p>"Then you shall stay with Sydney," decided
Hope. "But I am only going to fish a little
while, anyway, because I've got something else
I want to do." She looked up at Livingston,
who had come near her, and laughed. "Yes,
you may go with me if you will show me how
to cast a fly. Sydney says you are an expert
fisherman, but I don't know the first thing
about it. We will walk up the creek and fish
down, because the boys are fishing down here."
She called to the boy, who was walking toward
the stream: "I'll be ready to go home in about
an hour, wait for me!" He nodded in reply.
"Come on," she said to Livingston.</p>

<p>They had fished in silence some minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
far up the stream at an open point where several
other smaller streams joined this, forming
a broad group of tiny, gravelly islands.</p>

<p>"I do think," said the girl finally, "that
this is great sport, though I cannot haul them
out like you do. Now it must be luck&mdash;nothing
more, for we both have exactly the same
kind of flies."</p>

<p>"You leave your fly too long in the water,"
said the man. "You should cast more&mdash;like
this."</p>

<p>"But I can't for the life of me get the hang
of it," she exclaimed, making a desperate attempt.</p>

<p>"Not like that," said Livingston. "Look,
this is the way. There, you've caught yourself!"</p>

<p>"Yes, how foolish," laughed the girl. "It's
in there to stay, too!"</p>

<p>"Wait, I will assist you," he said, leaping
across the stream which separated them, and
coming to her side.</p>

<p>"I think I can get it out all right," she said,
throwing down her pole, and using on the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>tangled
hook more force than discretion. She
laughed in a half-vexed manner at her attempts,
while Livingston stood near watching,
his eyes earnest, intent, his face illumed
by a soft, boyish smile of quiet enjoyment.</p>

<p>"If I had another hook I'd cut this off
and leave it in there," she said, "but the fishing
is too fine to leave now. No, wait a minute,"
motioning him back with the disengaged hand
while she tugged vigorously at the hook with
the other. "I can do it. If only the material
in this waist wasn't so strong, I might tear it
out. How perfectly idiotic of me to do such
a thing, anyway!" Her cheeks were aflame
with the exertion. "You see," she continued,
still twisting her neck and looking down sideways
at the shoulder of her gown where the
hook was imbedded, "I don't want to break
it because we'd have to go way back to the
camp and start in over, and then it would be
too late in the day. I don't see what possessed
that fish to get away with my other hook! But
this goods simply won't tear!"</p>

<p>"There's no other way," declared Living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>ston,
with conviction. "You will have to let
me help you. I'll cut it out. See," he scrutinized
the hook very closely, while Hope
threw down her arms in despair, "it's only held
by a few threads. If you don't mind doing
a little mending, I will perform the operation
in a moment to your entire satisfaction."</p>

<p>"Well, hurry, please, because we are certainly
wasting good time and lots of fish."</p>

<p>"If all time were but wasted like this," he
exclaimed softly, prolonging the task.</p>

<p>She knew that he was taking undue advantage
of the situation and that she was
strangely glad of it, recklessly glad, in her
own fashion. She had never looked at him
so closely before. In this position he could
not see her. She noticed his broad, white forehead,
and felt a strong desire to touch the hair
that dropped over it, then admonished herself
for feeling glad at his slowness.</p>

<p>From the hillside above them a man on a
piebald horse watched the scene interestedly.
Without warning the girl's eyes lifted suddenly
from the soft, brown hair so near, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
met those of the rider above. Livingston's
head was bent close to her own, so that he did
not see the leering, grinning face that peered
down at them, but Hope caught the look direct,
and all, and more, than it seemed to imply.
Her eyes glittered with anger. Like a
flash her hand sought her blouse and for an
instant the bright sunlight gleamed upon a
small weapon. As quickly the man wheeled
his horse and disappeared behind the hill. With
a deep flush the girl hid the little revolver as
Livingston, ignorant of the scene, triumphantly
held up for inspection the rescued
fishhook.</p>

<p>"Making love, by the holy smoke," chuckled
Shorty Smith to himself, spurring up his piebald
horse and heading off a stray calf. "So
that's what she does 'longside o' teachin' kids!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>Upon the highest ridge between the
camp and old Peter's basin Hope and
the twins met Ned riding slowly along,
his sturdy little legs drawn up into the straps
of a man's saddle. He had an old, discarded
felt hat of his father's, several sizes too large
for him, pulled down until his ears laid flat
along the brim. From under its wide, dingy
expanse his sharp, little black eyes peered
out inquisitively. In imitation of a certain
French breed whom he greatly admired, a
large red handkerchief was knotted about his
waist.</p>

<p>He made a picturesque little figure in the
bright sunlight as he rode leisurely toward
them.</p>

<p>"Where've you all been?" he called at the
top of his boyish treble. "You boys're goin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to catch it if you don't bring in those cows before
dark!"</p>

<p>"Who told you?" roared Dave.</p>

<p>"The old man told me to come an' look you
fellers up. Where've you been?" inquired the
child, riding up alongside and swinging his
horse into pace with the others.</p>

<p>"Now you want to find out something,"
said Dan complacently.</p>

<p>"I don't <i>care</i> where you've been," said
the child indignantly, "but you'd better be
roundin' in them cows or you'll catch it!"</p>

<p>Hope rode up beside him. "I'm sorry you
weren't home when we left. We've been over
at my cousin's camp. The next time you shall
go along."</p>

<p>"Let's go to-morrow," suggested the boy
eagerly, to which amusing proposition she immediately
agreed. "Say," he continued, "I
seen Long Bill and some o' them fellers drive
in a bunch of mavericks off'n the range, an'
they're goin' to brand 'em back of old Peter's
this evenin'. There was a cow with an O Bar
brand on her, followed 'em all the way down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
bellerin' an' makin' a big fuss, an' they can't
get rid of her. They give me a half a dollar
to drive her back, but she turned so quick I
couldn't do nothin' with her, so I thought I'd
just let 'em take care of her themselves."</p>

<p>"Are you sure about that brand?" asked
Hope quickly.</p>

<p>"Sure as anything," replied the boy.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"I think you must be mistaken," she told
him. "For it would be very queer if one of
my father's cows should be following a stray
maverick up to old Peter's place."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you something," whispered the
boy, leaning toward her. "They wasn't yearlings
at all, they was bringin' in, only big
calves."</p>

<p>Her face darkened savagely. "Come," she
exclaimed, "I'm going to see for myself!"</p>

<p>"Tattle-tale!" cried the sweet-voiced twin.
"Now you'll get us into a scrape for tellin'.
I'll lick you for this!"</p>

<p>The girl turned her horse sharply about,
stopped it short, facing them fiercely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"You coward!" she exclaimed. "That
child didn't know what he was telling! He's
honest. If either of you touch him, or say
one unkind word to him about this, I'll make
you smart for it!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean nothin'," declared the soft-voiced
twin suavely.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you didn't if you know
what's good for you!" she exclaimed, still angry.
"Now what are you going to do about
it, go home like babies, or stand by me and do
what I tell you?"</p>

<p>"You bet I'll stand by you!" roared Dave.</p>

<p>"I reckon you're our captain, ain't you?"
said the other sweetly.</p>

<p>"I'm a scout, I am!" exclaimed the boy,
Ned, riding close beside her.</p>

<p>She mused for a moment with darkening
eyes, putting her elbow upon the saddle's horn
and resting her chin in the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>"It's all right," she said at length deliberately.
"Ned will show you where the cow is,
and you boys drive it up to old Peter's corral
just as quickly as you can ride. Don't let any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>one
see you. When you have done that, go up
to the school-house and wait there for me. Now
hurry, and don't let anyone see you drive in
that cow. Go around this other side of old
Peter's."</p>

<p>She motioned her hand for them to go, and
waited until they were out of sight, then rode
on to the school coulee which led into old
Peter's basin. It was a long, roundabout
way, but her horse covered the ground rapidly.</p>

<p>From the hill behind the school-house she
saw Livingston driving back to his ranch. She
stood out in full relief against the green hillside,
and if he had glanced in that direction
must surely have seen her. From that distance
she could not tell if he had done so or not. She
wondered what he would think if he saw her
there alone. Then to get sooner out of sight
she ran her horse at full speed up the school
coulee toward old Peter's basin.</p>

<p>Livingston saw her quite plainly; from that
distance there was no mistaking her. Then he
proceeded to do a very unwise thing. He put
his horses to their full speed, reached his sta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>bles
in a few moments, threw his saddle on his
best horse and set out in the direction the girl
had taken.</p>

<p>Hope made her way quickly up to the top
of the divide, then skirmished from brush patch
to brush patch, keeping well out of sight until
she reached the brush-covered entrance of Peter's
basin. There she had a plain view of the
small cabin, the rude stable, and corral, without
herself being observed by the occupants
of the place, and there she settled herself to
wait the appearance of the cow, whose queer
actions had been reviewed to her.</p>

<p>It was difficult to believe that she was actually
in the midst of cattle thieves, though the
suspicion had more than once crossed her mind.</p>

<p>She held that class of men in the utmost
loathing, and felt herself to be, now, in the
actual discovery of the crime, a righteous instrument
in the arm of justice.</p>

<p>The unmistakable figure of Long Bill
loafed serenely in the doorway; old Peter
hobbled about, in and out of the house, while
back near the corral a man was carrying an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
armful of wood. This man the girl watched
with particular interest. He took the sticks
to one side of the corral, and getting down
upon his knees proceeded to arrange them on
the ground in methodical order, into the shape
of a small pyramid. That done to his satisfaction,
he lounged back to the cabin and took
a seat beside Long Bill in the doorway.</p>

<p>Presently all three men went back to the
corral, and looked over the rails at several
small creatures which were running about the
enclosure.</p>

<p>"Them ain't bad-lookin' fellers," Long Bill
was saying.</p>

<p>Hope, from her position in the brush, tried
to imagine what they were talking about, for
the distance was too great to carry the sound
of their voices.</p>

<p>"I reckon we might as well git 'em branded
an' have it over with," suggested Shorty
Smith, the third man of the party.</p>

<p>"I reckon we might as well," replied Long
Bill. Old Peter shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he grunted. "But remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
I don't know nothin' about these here calves!
You're just usin' my corral here to-day, an' the
devil keep your skins if you git caught!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" drawled Shorty Smith.</p>

<p>"Well, I know!" roared the old man.
"If you can't take my advice an' put this here
thing off till after dark you kin take the consequences.
Anybody's likely to ride along
here, an' I'd like to know what kind of a yarn
you'd have to tell!"</p>

<p>"Now you know them calves 're yourn,"
drawled Shorty Smith, in an aggravating tone,
as he climbed up and seated himself on the top
pole of the corral. "You know them 're
yourn, every blame one, an' their mothers 're
back in the hills there!"</p>

<p>"Your cows all had twins, so you picked out
these here ones to wean 'em, if anybody should
ask," said Long Bill, continuing the sport.</p>

<p>The old man uttered a string of oaths.</p>

<p>"Not much you don't pan 'em off onto me!"
he exclaimed. "My cows ain't havin' twins
this year!"</p>

<p>"Some of Harris' has got triplets," mused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Shorty Smith, at which Long Bill laughed,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Been lary ever since them stock-inspectors
was up here last fall, ain't you? Before that
some o' your cows had a half a dozen calves.
I should 'a' thought you had more grit'n that,
Peter!"</p>

<p>The old man cursed some more. Shorty
Smith jumped down from his high perch and
fetched a long, slender rod of iron from between
two logs of the cow-shed.</p>

<p>"Might as well git down to business," he
said as he threw the branding iron on the
ground beside the symmetrical pyramid of
fire-wood, which he proceeded to ignite.</p>

<p>"Let up, old man," growled Long Bill, "I'll
take the blame o' the whole concern an' you
ken rake in your share in the fall without any
interference whatsomever."</p>

<p>"Don't git scared, Peter, you ain't got long
to live on this here planet, nohow, so you can
finish your days in peace. If there's any time
to be served we'll do it for you," drawled
Shorty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I call a mighty generous
proposition," remarked Long Bill, as he coiled
up his rope. "We'll just git the orniments on
these innocent creatures an' shut 'em up in the
shed fer a spell."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Git the job over with if you
ain't goin' to wait till after sundown," exclaimed
old Peter nervously.</p>

<p>They set to work at once, roping, throwing,
and putting a running brand on the frightened
calves. As each one was finished to the
satisfaction of the operator it was put into the
cow-shed nearby&mdash;a rude sort of stable,
where it was turned loose and the door securely
fastened on the outside with a large wooden
peg.</p>

<p>They had been working industriously for
perhaps half an hour when old Peter glanced
up from the calf upon which he was sitting and
encountered Hope Hathaway's quiet eyes
watching them interestedly. She stood beside
the cow-shed but a few feet away, and
held her horse by the bridle.</p>

<p>"Good God!" screamed the old man, nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
losing his balance. "Where did you come
from?"</p>

<p>The other men, whose backs were toward
her, glanced about quickly, then proceeded in
well assumed unconcern with the work upon
which they were engaged.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not intruding," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Shorty Smith politely.
"It ain't often we're favored by the company
of wimmen folks."</p>

<p>"Those are fine-looking calves you've got
there," observed the girl.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," replied Shorty Smith, assisting
the animal to its feet.</p>

<p>The visitor stepped to one side while he
dragged it into the shed and closed the door,
fastening it with the peg. Then Long Bill
proceeded to throw another victim with as
much coolness as though Hope had not been
there with her quiet eyes taking in every detail.</p>

<p>Old Peter had not uttered a word since his
first involuntary exclamation, and though
visibly agitated, proceeded in a mechanical
manner to assist with the branding, but he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
his head down and his eyes obstinately averted
from the girl's.</p>

<p>Nearly a dozen had been branded, and only
one, besides the last victim already thrown to
the ground, remained in the corral.</p>

<p>Hope's whole attention was apparently
taken up with the branding, which she watched
with great interest. Old Peter gradually regained
his equilibrium, while Long Bill and
Shorty Smith had begun to congratulate themselves
that their spectator was most innocent
and harmless. Yet as Hope moved quietly
back to her position beside the rude stable
building she not only observed the three men
intent upon the branding, but noted the approach
of a large cow which had appeared
from the right-hand coulee about the time she
left her hiding-place in the brush.</p>

<p>If the men had not been so busy they would
undoubtedly have seen this particular cow
coming on steadily toward the corral, now but
a rod distant. They would have noticed, too,
the girl's hand leave her side like a flash and
remove the large, smooth peg from where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Shorty Smith had hastily inserted it in the
building. They would have seen the stable
door open slowly by its own weight, and then
the peg quickly replaced. What they did notice
was that Miss Hathaway came very near
to them, so close that she leaned over old Peter's
shoulders to observe the smoking, steaming
operation.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood there quietly, then
all at once exclaimed in some surprise:</p>

<p>"Why, your calves are all out!" Instantly
the greatest consternation reigned, then old
Peter hobbled to his feet with an oath.</p>

<p>"Every blamed one," said Shorty Smith.
"How 'n blazes did that happen?"</p>

<p>"I reckon you didn't put that peg in right,"
drawled Long Bill.</p>

<p>"Look!" screamed old Peter, pointing at
the large cow that had come nearer and had
picked out from the assortment of calves one
of which it claimed absolute possession. It
was at this unfortunate moment that Livingston,
quite unobserved, rode into Peter's basin.</p>

<p>"I'll help you drive them in," volunteered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Hope, instantly mounting her horse and riding
into their midst. Then a queer thing followed.
Old Peter, with a cat-like motion, sprang
toward her and covered her with a six-shooter.</p>

<p>"Git off'n my place, you she-devil!" he
cried, his face livid with rage and fear.</p>

<p>"Good God, don't shoot, you fool!" cried
Shorty Smith, while Long Bill made a stride
toward the frenzied old man.</p>

<p>Livingston's heart stood still. He was
some distance away and, as usual, unarmed.
For an instant he stopped short, paralyzed by
the sight. Then the girl wheeled her horse
suddenly about as if to obey the command.
As she did so a report rang out and old Peter,
with the flesh ripped from wrist to elbow,
rolled over in a convulsed heap. It was all so
sudden that it seemed unreal. Hope sat on
her quivering horse, motionless, serene, holding
in her hand a smoking revolver.</p>

<p>Long Bill and his companion stood like statues,
dumfounded for the instant, but Livingston,
with a bound, was at the girl's side,
his face white, his whole being shaken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God!" he cried in great tenderness.
"You are all right!"</p>

<p>"What made you come here?" she exclaimed
in sudden nervousness, which sounded
more like impatience.</p>

<p>Then their eyes met. Her own softened,
then dropped, until they rested upon the gun
in her hand. A flush rose to her face and her
heart beat strangely, for in his eyes she had
seen the undisguised love of a great, true soul.
For an instant she was filled with the wild
intoxication of it, then the present situation,
which might now involve him, returned to her
with all its seriousness. The danger must be
averted at once, she decided, before he learned
the actual truth.</p>

<p>"Poor old man!" she exclaimed. Then
turned to Long Bill and his companion. "I'm
awfully sorry I had to hurt him, but he actually
made me nervous! I had an idea he was crazy,
but I never believed he was perfectly mad.
He ought to be watched constantly and all
dangerous weapons kept away from him.
Didn't you know he was dangerous?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Shorty Smith suddenly rose to meet the
situation.</p>

<p>"I knowed he was crazy," he said, "but I
didn't know he was as plumb locoed as that."</p>

<p>"Well, he's out of business for awhile,"
remarked the girl. "You boys better bandage
up his arm and carry him into the house. I'll
send over old Mother White Blanket when I
get back. I guess you can get in the calves by
yourselves all right, for really I feel very
shaken and I think I'll go right home. You'll
go with me, won't you, Mr. Livingston. But
the poor old crazy man! You boys will take
good care of him, won't you&mdash;and let me know
if I can be of any assistance."</p>

<p>"Well, what do yo' think?" asked Shorty
Smith, as Hope and her companion disappeared
from the basin.</p>

<p>"What'd I think?" exclaimed Long Bill.
"I think we've been pretty badly <i>done</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," drawled Shorty Smith,
"I reckon she ain't goin' to say nothin' about
<i>me</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'd do 'bout it, if I was
you," said Shorty Smith to the twins, several
days later, as he handed back a folded
sheet of paper. "I'd git your teacher to read
that there letter. There's something in it she
ought to know 'bout. Better not tell her first
where you got it. Let on you don't know
where it come from. There's somethin' there
she'll like to hear 'bout, that you kids ain't old
enough to understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so!" interposed Dan.</p>

<p>"I ain't a-goin' to tell you nothin' about it,
but like enough she will, an'll thank you fer
givin' it to her," said Shorty.</p>

<p>"If that writin' wasn't so funny I'd make
it out myself," replied the soft-voiced twin,
"fer I think you're jobbin' us, Shorty."</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," he replied. "An' I'll back up
my friendship fer you by givin' you this!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
He took from his pocket a silver dollar and
handed it to the boy, who pocketed it, and, followed
by his brother, walked away without another
word.</p>

<p>Shorty Smith also walked away, in the
opposite direction, without a word, but he
chuckled to himself, and his mood was exceedingly
jubilant.</p>

<p>"She done us all right, an' may play the
devil yet, but I'll git in a little work, er my
name ain't Shorty Smith!" Such was the substance
of his thoughts during the next few
days.</p>

<p>That afternoon Hope stood in the doorway
of the school-house, watching her little brood
of pupils straggling down the hill.</p>

<p>Louisa, who came daily to be with her beloved
friend, had started home with the two
eldest Harris girls, for Hope, in her capacity
of teacher, occasionally found work to detain
her for a short time after the others had gone.
This teaching school was not exactly play,
after all.</p>

<p>The twins lingered behind, seemingly en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>gaged
in a quiet discussion. Finally they came
back to the door.</p>

<p>"Here's somethin' for you to read," said
the soft-voiced boy, handing her a folded paper,
while Dave leaned against the building
with an ugly scowl on his face.</p>

<p>"To read," asked Hope, turning it over in
her hand. "Who wrote it, and where did you
get it?" She stepped out of the doorway onto
the green grass beside them.</p>

<p>"Read it," said the breed boy. "It's somethin'
you ought to know."</p>

<p>"Something I ought to know? But who
wrote it?" insisted the girl.</p>

<p>"A woman, I reckon," replied the boy.
"You just read it, an' then you'll know all
about it."</p>

<p>Hope laughed, and slowly opened the much
soiled, creased missive. "Why didn't you tell
me at once that it was for me?" she asked.</p>

<p>The writing was in a bold, feminine back-hand,
and held her attention for a moment. The
thought occurred to her that Clarice might
have written from the ranch, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
something unfamiliar about it. She looked
first at the signature. "Your repentant
Helene," it was signed. Helene,&mdash;who was
Helene, she wondered; then turned the paper
over. "My darling Boy," it started. In her
surprise she said the words aloud.</p>

<p>"Why, that's not for me! Where did you
boys get this letter? Now tell me!" She was
very much provoked with them.</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin smiled.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like to know what was in
it," he remarked, in evident earnestness.</p>

<p>"That doesn't answer my question," she said
with some impatience. "<i>Where</i> did you get
it?"</p>

<p>"We found it," replied Dave gruffly, still
scowling.</p>

<p>"And you boys bring a letter to <i>me</i> that was
intended for someone else, and <i>expect</i> me to
<i>read</i> it!" She folded it up and handed it back
to the boy. "Go and give that to whom it belongs,
and remember it's very wrong to read
another person's letter. Tell me where you
got it. I insist upon knowing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we just found it up on the hill last
night," replied the soft-voiced twin evasively.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell her the whole shootin'
match!" roared the blunt Dave. "You're a
dandy! We found it up in the spring coulee
last night near where Mr. Livingston's sheep're
camped. He was up there before dark, cuttin'
'em out. This here letter dropped out of his
pocket when he threw his coat on a rock up
there, an' so Dan an' me an' Shorty Smith
came along an' picked it up."</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingston's," said Hope, suddenly
feeling oddly alarmed. "Not <i>his</i>&mdash;you must
be mistaken! Why, it began&mdash;it was too&mdash;<i>informal</i>&mdash;even
for a sister, and he has no sister,
he told me so!"</p>

<p>"It's for him all right, for here's the envelope."
Dan took it from his pocket and
handed it to her. It left no room for doubt.
It was directed to him, and bore an English
postmark. He had no sister. Then it must
be from his sweetheart&mdash;and he told her he
had no sweetheart. A sudden pain consumed
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon it's from his wife," said the soft-voiced
twin.</p>

<p>"He has no wife," said Hope quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he has! That's what they say,"
declared the boy.</p>

<p>"They lie," she replied softly. "I <i>know</i>
he has no wife."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you he left her in England," said
the boy. "That's what the men say."</p>

<p>"Your repentant Helene," repeated the girl
over and over to herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly suspicion, jealousy, rage, entered
her heart, setting her brain on fire. She turned
to the boy like a fury. "Give me that letter!"</p>

<p>Frightened beyond speech by the storm in
her black eyes, he handed it to her and watched
her as with a set face and strangely brilliant
eyes she began to read. Every word branded
itself upon her heart indelibly.</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My Darling Boy</span>: Can it be that you
actually refuse to allow me to come there?
Admitting I have wronged you in the past,
can you not in your greatness of heart find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
forgiveness for a weak woman&mdash;a pleading
woman&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>


<p>There at the foot of the first page the girl
stopped, a sudden terror coming over her.</p>

<p>"<i>What have I done!</i>" she cried, crushing the
letter in her hand. "<i>What have I done!</i>"
Hysterically she began tearing it into small
pieces, throwing them upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Now we can't give it back to him," deplored
the twin, recovering from his fright.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" repeated the girl
again, softly. Then in an agony of remorse
she went down upon her knees in the cool grass
and picked up each tiny scrap of paper, putting
it all back into the envelope. She stood
for a moment looking down the long green
slope below, shamed, disgusted&mdash;a world of
misery showing in her dark eyes. "You're a
mighty fine specimen of womanhood!" she
exclaimed aloud; then turning about suddenly
became aware that her small audience was
watching her with some interest.</p>

<p>"You boys get on your ponies and go right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
straight home!" she exclaimed in a burst of
temper. "You're very bad, both of you, and
I've a good notion to punish you!" She went
into the school-house and slammed the door,
while the twins lost no time in leaving the
premises. Not far away they met old Jim McCullen.</p>

<p>"Where's your teacher?" he asked, stopping
his horse in the road.</p>

<p>"She's back there," said the soft-voiced
twin, pointing toward the school-house. "But
you'd better stay away, for she's got blood in
her eye to-day!"</p>

<p>"No wonder, you young devils!" laughed
Jim, riding on.</p>

<p>He knocked at the school-house door and,
receiving no answer, walked in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim!" exclaimed the girl, rising from
the small table at the end of the room. "I
thought it was some of the children returning.
I'm awfully glad to see you! You've been
gone an age. Come, sit down here in this
chair, I'm afraid those seats aren't large
enough for you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll just sit on this here recitation bench,"
replied Jim, "that's what you call it, ain't it?
I want to see how it feels to be in school again.
I reckon it'll hold me all right."</p>

<p>He seated himself with some care, while the
teacher sank back at her table.</p>

<p>"You don't seem very pert-lookin', Hopie,"
he continued, noticing her more carefully.
"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>She looked down at her papers, then up at
him with something of a smile.</p>

<p>"I'm twenty years old," she replied, "and
I don't know as much as I did ten years ago."</p>

<p>"You know too much," replied McCullen.
"You know too much to be happy, an' you
think too much. You wasn't happy at home,
so you come up here, an' now your gittin' the
same way here. You'll have to git married,
Hopie, an' settle down; there ain't no other
way."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed the girl, "that would
settle me sure enough! What a horrible proposition
to consider! Just look at my mother&mdash;beset
with nervousness and unrest; look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
that poor Mrs. Cresmond and a dozen others&mdash;perfect
slaves to their husbands. Look at
Clarice&mdash;she never knew a moment's happiness
until Henry Van Rensselaer died! Yes,
I think marriage <i>settles</i> a girl all right!
What terrible mismated failures on every
hand! It's simply appalling, Jim! I've never
yet known one perfectly happy couple, and
how any girl who sees this condition about her,
everywhere, can dream her own ideal love
dream, picture her ideal man, and plan
and believe in an ideal life, while she herself
is surrounded by such pitiful object-lessons,
is a wonder!"</p>

<p>"I ain't much of a philosopher," said old
Jim, "but it's always been my notion that most
wimmen <i>don't</i> see what's goin' on around 'em.
They think their own troubles is worse'n anybody's
an' 're so taken up whinin' over 'em that
their view is somewhat obstructed. Take the
clear-headed person that <i>can</i> see, an' they ain't
a-goin' to run into any matrimonial fire, no
more'n I'm goin' to head my horse over a cut-bank.
They're goin' straight after the happi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>ness
they know exists, an' they ain't goin' to
make no mistake about it neither, if they've
got any judgment, whatever."</p>

<p>"What made my mother marry my father?"
asked the girl, lifting up her head and
facing old Jim squarely. "That's the worst
specimen of ill-assorted marriages I know of."</p>

<p>Jim McCullen looked perplexed for an instant.</p>

<p>"I don't think that was in the beginning,"
he replied thoughtfully, "but your mother got
to hankerin' after her city life, her balls an'
theaters an' the like o' that. After she got a
fall from her horse an' couldn't ride no more
she didn't seem to take interest in anything at
the ranch, an' kept gettin' more nervous all the
time. I reckon her health had something to do
with it, an' then she got weaned from the
ranch, bein' away so much. It wasn't her life
any more."</p>

<p>"And now even her visits there are torture
to her," said Hope bitterly. "She is drunk
with the deadly wine of frivolous uselessness&mdash;society!"
Then sadly, "What a wealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
happiness she might have possessed had she
chosen wisely!"</p>

<p>"But she was like a ship without a rudder;
she didn't have no one to guide her, an' now she
thinks she's happy, I reckon," remarked McCullen,
adding, after a pause, "If she thinks
at all!"</p>

<p>"And poor Clarice was a baby when <i>she</i>
married," mused the girl.</p>

<p>"And that Cresmond woman always was a
blame fool," concluded Jim. "So there's
hope for you yet, don't you reckon there is?
That reminds me, here's a letter from O'Hara.
There's a nice fellow for you, Hopie."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a good boy, Larry is," she remarked
absently, taking the letter he handed
to her.</p>

<p>"Why, he says he is coming over here to
stay awhile with Sydney, and he hopes I won't
be&mdash;&mdash;" She smiled a little and tucked the
letter in her belt. "That'll keep," she said.
"Come on, I'm going over to camp with you,
Jim."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>"Your horse don't look very tired," remarked
the girl as they rode easily
up the gulch toward Carter's camp.
"When did you start?"</p>

<p>"Left 'bout noon," replied McCullen.
"No, he ain't tired; ain't even warm, be you,
old man? Just jogged along easy all the way
an' took my time. No great rush, anyhow.
Cattle 're gittin' pretty well located up here
now&mdash;good feed, fresh water, an' everything
to attract 'em to the place. Never saw any
stock look better'n that little bunch o' steers is
lookin'. Market's way up now, an' they ought
to be shipped pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Why <i>don't</i> you ship them, then?" asked
Hope, leaning forward to brush a hornet from
her horse's head.</p>

<p>"Oh, you see," said the man lamely, "them
cattle ain't in such all-fired good fix but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
they might be better, an' I reckon your cousin
ain't in any hurry to ship, nohow. Pretty good
place to camp up here in summer. Cool&mdash;my,
but it was blasted hot down at the ranch
this mornin', an' the misquitoes like to eat me
up! No misquitoes up here to bother, good
water, good fishin', good company,&mdash;an' who
under the sun would want to quit such a
camp?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing," said the girl, looking at him
with fathomless eyes, "I'm perfectly willing
for him to camp here all summer. It's quite
convenient to have you all so near. Of course
I'm getting used to the grub down there&mdash;some,
by this time. Don't think I do not appreciate
your being here, dear old Jim! But
you know I understand, just the same, why
you are here! And I think," she added softly,
"I couldn't have stood it if he hadn't showed
that he cared for me just so."</p>

<p>"Cared!" exclaimed the old fellow.
"Cared <i>for you</i>! Why, Hopie, your father
worships the ground you walk on! He's a
great, good-hearted man, the best in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and you mustn't have no hard feelin's agin'
him for any little weaknesses, because the good
in him is more'n the good in most men. There
ain't no one that's perfect, but he's better'n
most of us, I reckon. An' he loves you, an' is
so proud of you, Hopie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it, I know it!" exclaimed the
girl passionately.</p>

<p>"An' your mother's goin' East next month,"
concluded McCullen. "She's very anxious to
get away."</p>

<p>"My poor father!" said Hope softly. Then
more brightly: "I suppose Sydney's out with
the cattle."</p>

<p>"Them cattle 're gettin' pretty well located,"
replied McCullen. "Don't need much
herdin'. No, I seen him there at Harris' as I
come along. He said he was goin' to take you
an' that little flaxen-haired girl out ridin', but
concluded, as long as you was busy at the
school-house, that he'd just take the little one&mdash;providin'
she'd go. He was arguin' the
question with her when I rode by, an' I reckon
he's there talkin' to her yet, er else givin' her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
a ridin' lesson. He'll make a good horsewoman
out o' her yet, if her heart ain't buried
too deep up there under the rocks."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim!" rebuked the girl. "It's <i>dreadful</i>
to talk like that, and her poor heart is just
<i>crushed</i>! It's pitiful!"</p>

<p>"I reckon that's just what Sydney thinks
about it," replied Jim, his eyes twinkling.
"You ain't goin' to blame him for bein' sympathetic,
be you, Hopie?"</p>

<p>She laughed, but nervously.</p>

<p>"Louisa's the sweetest thing I ever saw,
Jim! She's promised to stay and go back
to the ranch with me in the fall when school is
over. Isn't it nice to have a sister like that?
But goodness, she wouldn't look at Syd&mdash;not
in ten years!"</p>

<p>She was so positive in this assertion that it
left Jim without an argument. She slowed
down her horse to a walk, and he watched
her take O'Hara's letter from her belt and
read the lengthy epistle from beginning to
end. Not a change of expression crossed the
usual calm of her face. But for a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
force of beauty and power, by which she impressed
all with whom she came in contact, her
lack of expression would have been a defect.
This peculiar characteristic was an added
charm to her strange personality. She was
rarely understood by her best friends, who
generally occupied themselves by wondering
what she was going to do next.</p>

<p>It may be that old Jim McCullen, calmly
contemplating her from his side of the narrow
trail, wondered too, but he had the advantage
of most people, for he knew that whatever she
did do would be the nearest thing to her hand.
There was nothing variable or fitful about
Hope.</p>

<p>She folded her letter and tucked it back
in her belt, her only comment being, as she
spurred her horse into a faster gait: "Larry
says he is coming over here one of these
days."</p>

<p>They rode past the camp and on to the flat
beyond, where grazed Sydney's two hundred
head of steers. These they rode around, while
Jim reviewed the news of the ranch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
round-up, in which the girl found some interest,
asking numerous questions about the recent
shipment of cattle, the tone of the market,
the prospect for hay, the number of cattle
turned on the range, and many things pertaining
to the work of the ranch, but never a question
concerning the idle New Yorkers who
made up her mother's annual house-party. In
them she took, as usual, no interest.</p>

<p>She finally left her old friend and turned
her horse's head back toward Harris' still as
much perturbed in heart as when McCullen
knocked at her school-house door. She tormented
herself with unanswerable questions,
arriving always at the same conclusion&mdash;that
after all it only seemed reasonable to suppose
Livingston should be married. It explained
his conduct toward her perfectly. She wondered
what the woman, Helene, had done to
deserve such unforgiveness from one who,
above all men, was the most tender and
thoughtful. She concluded that it must have
been something dreadful, and, oddly for her,
began to feel sorry for him. She saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
when she reached the top of the divide, riding
half a mile away toward his ranch buildings.
Then a certain feeling of ownership, of
pride, took possession of her, crowding everything
before it. How well he sat his horse, in
his English fashion, she thought. What a
physique, what grace of strength! Then he
disappeared from her sight as his horse
plunged into the brush of the creek-bottom,
and Hope, drawing a long breath, spurred up
her own horse until she was safely out of sight
of ranch and ranch-buildings. A bend in the
road brought her face to face with Long Bill
and Shorty Smith.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Shorty Smith, drawing rein
beside her. "I was a lookin' for you."</p>

<p>"Really," said the girl, stopping beside him
and calmly contemplating both men.</p>

<p>"Yep," nodded Long Bill politely, "we
was huntin' fer you, Miss Hathaway."</p>

<p>"You see it's like this," explained Shorty
Smith; "the old man, he ain't a-doin' very well.
I reckon it's his age. That there wound of
his'n won't heal, so we thought mebby you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
some arnica salve er something sort o' soothin'
to dope him with."</p>

<p>"I haven't the salve, but I might go over
there myself if you want an anodyne," replied
Hope, unsmiling at the men's blank faces.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to ride to town to-morrow and I
reckoned if you didn't have no salve you could
send in for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" Hope's exclamation came involuntarily.
"What do you want to get for
him and how much money do you want for
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, he needs considerable.
Ain't got nothin' comfortable over there;
nothin' to eat, wear&mdash;nothin' at all."</p>

<p>"All right," replied the girl in her cool, even
tone. "I'll see that he is supplied with everything,
but will attend to the matter myself.
Good-evening!" She rode past them rapidly,
and they, outwitted in their little scheme for
whisky-money, rode on their way toward old
Peter's basin.</p>

<p>Sydney's horse stood outside of Harris'.
He left a group of men who were waiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
call for supper, and came out in the road to
meet the girl when she rode up.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for you," he said.</p>

<p>"And I have been over to camp and around
the cattle with Jim," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then come on and ride back up the road
with me a ways, I want to see you," said
Carter, picking up the bridle reins from the
ground.</p>

<p>"But Louisa&mdash;&mdash;" she demurred.</p>

<p>"Louisa's all right," he answered. "I've
had her out for a ride, and now she's gone in
the house with that breed girl&mdash;Mary, I think
she called her. So you see she's in excellent
hands."</p>

<p>Hope turned her horse about and rode away
with him silently.</p>

<p>"I want to talk with you, anyway," he said,
when they had gone a short distance. "I
haven't had a chance in a dog's age, you're
always so hemmed in lately."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"There's some rumors going around that I
don't exactly understand, Hope. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
been doing anything since you've been up here
to raise a commotion among these breeds?"</p>

<p>She turned to him with a shrug of contempt.</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell me what you're driving
at before I can enlighten you," she replied.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he said, "I want to light
a cigarette." This accomplished, he continued:
"I saw one of the boys from Bill
Henry's outfit yesterday and he told me that
he was afraid you were getting mixed up in
some row up here."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> said so?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, it was Peterson. You know he'll say
what he's got to say, if he dies for it." He
waited a moment.</p>

<p>"If it was Peterson, go on. He's a friend,
if he is a fool. What did he have to say about
me?" She flecked some dust from her skirt
with the end of her reins.</p>

<p>Sydney watched her carefully.</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything, exactly, about
you," he replied. "That's what I'm going
to try to find out. He said there had been
some kind of a rumpus up here when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
first came&mdash;that shooting at Livingston's corral,
you remember, and that it was rumored
there had been some sharp-shooting done, and
you had been mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"Who told Peterson?" demanded the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that McCullen laid Long
Bill out one evening over at Bill Henry's
wagon, for something or other, and this old
squaw back here, old Mother White Blanket,
happened along in time to view the fallen
hero, who, it seems, is her son-in-law. She
immediately fell into a rage and denounced
a certain school-ma'am as a deep-dyed villain."</p>

<p>"Villainess," corrected Hope serenely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe that was it," continued Sydney.
"Anyway, she rated you roundly and
said you had been at the bottom of all the
trouble, that you had shot Long Bill through
the hand, wounded several others, and mentioned
the herder who was killed."</p>

<p>"She lied!" said the girl with sudden whiteness
of face. "That was a cold-blooded lie
about the herder!"</p>

<p>"I know that!" assured her cousin. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
don't suppose I ever thought for a minute you
were mixed up in it, Hopie, do you? I only
wanted to know how it happened that all these
people are set against you."</p>

<p>"Because they know I'm on to their deviltry,"
she replied savagely. "I'd like to have
that old squaw right here between my hands,
<i>so</i>, and hear her bones crackle. How dare they
say <i>I</i> shot Louisa's poor, poor sweetheart!
Oh, I could exterminate the whole tribe!"</p>

<p>"But that wouldn't be lawful, Hopie," remarked
Carter.</p>

<p>She turned to him with a half smile, resting
one hand confidingly upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Syd, dear, I don't care a bit about the
whole concern, really, but please don't mention
it to anyone, will you?"</p>

<p>"You mean not to tell Livingston," he
smiled.</p>

<p>"I mean not <i>anyone</i>. I shouldn't want my
father to hear such talk. Neither would you.
What wouldn't he do!"</p>

<p>"Of course not," he agreed. "You'd get
special summons, immediately, if not sooner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
But there's something more I wanted to ask
you about. How was it you happened to
shoot old Peter?"</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Now I promised I wouldn't mention the
matter," he replied.</p>

<p>She studied for a moment.</p>

<p>"There's only one way you could have
heard it," she finally decided in some anger.
"That person had no right to tell you."</p>

<p>"It was told with the best intentions, and
for your own good, Hope, so that I could look
after you more carefully in the future."</p>

<p>"Look after me!" she retorted. "Well, I
guess he found out there was one time I could
look out for myself, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to think that more a miracle or
an accident than anything else, until I told
him something about how quick you were with
a gun. He told me the old man was crazy,
and had pulled his gun on you, but that you
had in some remarkable manner shot it out of
his hand, shattering the old fellow's arm. I
assured him that I would see that the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
authorities took care of old Peter, as soon as
he had recovered sufficiently. Now what'll we
do with him, Hope?" She did not reply.
Then he continued: "I knew in a minute that
you'd kept the real facts of the case from Livingston.
But you're not going to keep them
from me."</p>

<p>"Now that you know as much as you do, I
suppose I've got to tell you or you'll be getting
yourself into trouble, too," she replied. Then
impulsively, "Sydney, they're a lot of cattle
thieves!"</p>

<p>"Why, of course! What did you expect?"
he laughed.</p>

<p>"And I actually <i>caught</i> them in the very
act of branding calves that didn't belong to
them!"</p>

<p>The young man's face paled perceptibly.</p>

<p>"You didn't do anything as reckless as that,
Hope!" he cried in consternation. "It's a
wonder they didn't kill you outright in self-protection!
Didn't you know that you have
to be blind to those things unless you're backed
up by some good men!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"You talk like a coward!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not much! You know I'm not that," he
replied. "But I talk sense. Now, if they
know that you have positive proof of this,
you'd better watch them!"</p>

<p>"They all need watching up here. I believe
they're all just the same. And, Syd, I
wanted to know the truth for myself, I
wanted to <i>see</i>." Then she reviewed to him
just what had happened at old Peter's.</p>

<p>"I'll have them locked up at once," said
Carter decisively. "That's just where they
belong."</p>

<p>"You won't do anything of the kind, Syd&mdash;not
at present, anyway, for I refuse to be
witness against them."</p>

<p>"You're foolish, then," he replied, "for
they're liable to do something."</p>

<p>"If they're quicker than I am, all right,"
she replied fearlessly. "But they are afraid
of me now, and I've got them <i>just where I
want them</i>."</p>

<p>He tried to reason with her, but in vain.
She was obstinate in her refusal to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
men arrested, and though Sydney studied the
matter carefully, he could find no plausible
excuse for this foolish decision.</p>

<p>As Hope rode back once more toward Harris'
the face of Shorty Smith, insinuatingly
leering, as she had seen it at the trout stream,
came again to torment her. She leaned forward
in her saddle, covering her face with her
hands, and felt in her whole being the reason
of her decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>Larry O'Hara rode up to Sydney's
camp late one afternoon, some two or
three weeks later, and finding the place
deserted went in the cook-tent and made himself
at home. It had been a long, hot, dusty
ride from Hathaway's home-ranch. He had
experienced some difficulty in finding the
place, and, having at length reached it, proceeded
with his natural adaptitude to settle
himself for a prolonged stay.</p>

<p>He was a great, handsome, prepossessing
young fellow, overflowing with high spirits
and good-nature. Though a natural born
American, he was still a typical Irishman, retaining
much of the brogue of his Irish parents,
which, being more of an attraction in him
than otherwise, he never took the trouble to
overcome. All the girls were in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Larry O'Hara, and he, in his great generosity
of heart, knew it, and loved them in return.</p>

<p>His affection for Hope Hathaway was
something altogether different, and dated two
or three years back when he first saw her skimming
across the prairie on an apparently unmanageable
horse. He proceeded to do the
gallant act of rescuing a lady. For miles he
ran the old cow-pony that had been assigned
him, in hot pursuit, and when he had from
sheer exhaustion almost dropped to the ground
she suddenly turned her horse about and
laughed in his face. It was an awkward situation.
The perspiration streamed from his
forehead, his breath came in gasps. She continued
laughing. He mopped his face furiously,
got control of his breath, and exclaimed
in deep emotion:</p>

<p>"Sure and is ridicule all I get when I have
followed you for ten miles on this baist of a
horse, to offer you a proposition of marriage?"</p>

<p>Their friendship dated from that moment,
and though Larry had renewed his proposition
of marriage every time he had seen her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
yet there had never been a break in their comradeship.</p>

<p>He looked about the well-appointed camp
with a sigh of contentment. This was something
like living, he thought. His enforced
confinement at the ranch had been slow torture
to him. He missed the presence of Hope
and Sydney, for to him they were the very
spirit of the place, and he was filled with
anxiety to get away from it and join them.</p>

<p>After washing the dust from his face and
hands he went through the cook's mess-box,
then, having nothing else to do, laid down for a
nap on one of the bunks in the second tent
and was soon sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>He never knew just how long he slept,
though he declared he had not closed his eyes,
when a whispered conversation outside the tent
brought him to his feet with a start. It was
suspicious to say the least, and he tore madly
at his roll of belongings in search of his revolver,
which he found in his hip-pocket, after
he had scattered his clothes from one end of the
tent to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not yet dark. The whispers came
now from the opposite tent. O'Hara's fighting
blood was up. He gloried in the situation.
Here was his opportunity to hold up some
thieving rascals. It was almost as good as being
a real desperado. It flashed upon him that
they might be the real article, but he would not
turn coward. He would show them what one
man could do!</p>

<p>He peered cautiously out of the tent. Two
horses with rough-looking saddles stood at
the edge of the brush not far away. Larry
O'Hara would not be afraid of two men.</p>

<p>He moved cautiously up to the front of the
cook-tent, and throwing open the flap called
out in thundering tones: "Throw up your
hands, ye thieving scoundrels, or I'll have
your loives!"</p>

<p>A pair of arms shot up near him like a flash,
while a choking sound came from the farther
side of the mess-box. Two startled, pie-be-grimed
boys gazed in amazement into the barrel
of Larry's gun, which he suddenly lowered,
overcome with surprise as great as their own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"May heaven preserve us!" he cried. "I
thought you were murdering thieves! But if
it's only supper you're after, I'll take a hand in
it meself!"</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin recovered first.</p>

<p>"Say, where'd you come from? I thought
that was the cook sleepin' in there an' we wasn't
goin' to disturb him to get our supper.
What're <i>you</i> doin' 'round here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I'm a special officer of the law, on the
lookout for some dangerous criminals," replied
Larry. "But I see I've made a great mistake
this time. It's not kids I'm after! I'll just
put this weapon back in my pocket to show
that I'm friendly inclined. And now let's have
something to eat. You boys must know the
ins and outs of this place pretty well, for I
couldn't find pie here when I came, or anything
that looked loike pie. Where'd you
make the raise?"</p>

<p>The boys began to breathe easier, although
an "officer of the law" was something of
which they stood in mortal terror. Yet this
particular "officer" seemed quite a jovial sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of a fellow, and they soon reached the conclusion
that he would be a good one to "stand
in" with. The soft-voiced twin sighed easily,
and settled himself into a familiar position at
the table, remarking as he did so:</p>

<p>"Oh, we're to home here! This camp belongs
to a friend of ourn." He pulled the
pie toward him. "Here, Dave," he said to
the other, who had also recovered from his surprise,
"throw me a knife from over there. I
reckon I ain't a-goin' to eat this here pie with
my fingers! An' get out some plates for him
an' you. No use waitin' for the cook to come
in an' get our supper. Ain't no tellin' where
he's gone."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty cool kid," remarked
O'Hara, helping himself to the pie. "I'll take
a piece of pie with you for company's sake,
though I'm inclined to wait for the cook of
this establishment. A good, warm meal is
more to my liking. Where do you fellows
live?"</p>

<p>"Over here a ways," replied Dan cautiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Know of any bad men that wants arresting?"
continued O'Hara. "I'm in the business
at present."</p>

<p>"I reckon I do," replied the boy, lowering
his voice to a soft, sweet tone. "There's a
mighty dangerous character I can put you
onto if you'll swear you'll never give me
away."</p>

<p>"I'll never breathe a word of it," declared
O'Hara; "just point out your man to me; I'll
fix him for you!"</p>

<p>"What'll you do to him?" asked Dan, in
great earnestness. O'Hara laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll do just whativer you say," he replied.
"What's his crime?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you," said the boy deliberately,
while Dave listened in open-mouthed
wonderment. "He's a bad character, a
tough one! He gits drunker'n a fool and
thinks he runs the earth, an' he licks his children
if they happen to open their heads! I
never seen him steal no horses, er kill anyone,
but he's a bad man, just the same, an' needs
lockin' up for 'bout six months!" Dave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
finally comprehending his twin, jumped up
and down, waving his arms wildly above his
head.</p>

<p>"You bet you! Lock him up, that's the
checker! Lock the old man in jail, an' we can
do just as we want to!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But you know," said O'Hara impressively,
his eyes twinkling with suppressed merriment,
"it's like this. There's a law that says if a
man&mdash;a <i>family</i> man&mdash;be sent to jail for anything
less than cold-blooded murder, his intire
family must go with him to look after him.
Didn't you ever hear of that new law? Now
that would be a bad thing for his boys, poor
things! It would be worse than the beating
they get. But you just give Larry
O'Hara the tip, and the whole family'll get
sent up!"</p>

<p>"Not much you don't!" roared Dave to his
twin, who for the instant seemed dumfounded
by this piece of news from the "officer of the
law."</p>

<p>"I reckon," said the soft-voiced schemer
after a quiet pause, "his boys 'ud rather take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the lickin's than get sent up, so you might as
well let him alone. You're sure there ain't no
mistake 'bout that? Don't seem like that's
quite right."</p>

<p>"Sure!" replied Larry, enjoying the situation
to its full extent.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't," decided the boy finally.
"I'm goin' to ask the teacher. Mebby you're
loadin' us. You bet she'll know!"</p>

<p>Larry O'Hara became suddenly awake to a
new interest. "Where is she&mdash;your teacher?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"I dunno," answered the boy. "Mebby
home."</p>

<p>At this juncture the flap of the tent was
pushed open and in bustled the little English
cook.</p>

<p>All three of the occupants started guiltily,
while William looked from his visitors to the
remnants of pie upon the table with some astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, Hi'll be blowed!" he ejaculated.
Then noticing that O'Hara was not an ordinary
specimen of Westerner, he changed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
expression and began wagging his head, offering
excuses for his tardiness.</p>

<p>"I had orders to get a warm bite at eight
o'clock, so I went out 'untin' a bit on my own
account. Did you come far, sir?"</p>

<p>"All the way from Hathaway's ranch,"
replied Larry. "And the way I took, it
couldn't have been a rod less than a hundred
moiles. Sure, every bone in me body is
complaining!"</p>

<p>"Too bad, that," condoled William. "Hit's
no easy road to find. I missed hit once, myself.
I think I seen you about the ranch,
didn't I? What's yer name?"</p>

<p>"I'm O'Hara," he replied. "If you
haven't seen me, you've heard about me, which
amounts to the same thing. I'm glad to see
you, my good man, for I began to suspect that
everyone had deserted camp. I was just going
to question these young natives here, as
to the whereabouts of the owners of this ranch,
when you came in."</p>

<p>The twins were sidling toward the front
of the tent with a view to hasty retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
when the cook fixed his sharp little eyes upon
them.</p>

<p>"Ain't I good enough to yous but you must
come an' clean out all my pastry when my back
is turned? Hi'll overlook hit this time, if you
get out an' chop me some wood. 'Urry up
now an' get to work! for they'll all be along
directly!" The boys made their escape from
the tent, while the cook continued: "They
all went out 'untin' after some antelope, way
up there on the big mountain. They'll be in
after a bit for a bite to heat, so if you'll excuse
me, Hi'll start things goin'."</p>

<p>The little cook put on his apron and hustled
about, while O'Hara went out and watched
the boys break up some sticks of wood which
they brought from the nearby brush.</p>

<p>"Here, give me the job," the young man
finally remarked. "It belongs to me by rights
for keeping you talking so long. If it hadn't
been for me you'd got away without being
seen. Here, hand over your ax, and get
along home with you!"</p>

<p>"Say, you're all right, if you do belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the law," said Dave, gladly giving up the ax.
They speedily made their escape, and none too
soon, for as they disappeared a group of riders
came in sight on the opposite side of the brush
and soon surrounded the wood-chopper with
hearty words of welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>"My dear boy, I'm glad to see you!"
called Sydney.</p>

<p>"Larry O'Hara chopping wood!
Impossible!" declared Hope, as Carter rode
on past her. "It's an illusion&mdash;a vanishing
vision. Our eyes deceive us!"</p>

<p>"But it is a young man there," said Louisa.
"A big one like Mr. Livingston, not so slim
like Sydney&mdash;your cousin."</p>

<p>"True enough," laughed Hope. "But it is
the occupation&mdash;the ax, Louisa, dear. I
never knew Larry to do a stroke of work!"</p>

<p>"Ach, but he is handsome!" whispered
Louisa.</p>

<p>"Don't let him know you think so," returned
Hope. "He's spoiled badly enough now."
She turned to the man who rode on her opposite
side. "He's from the ranch&mdash;one of the
guests from New York. He's the <i>dearest</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
character!" After which exclamation she
rode ahead and greeted the newcomer.</p>

<p>"It never rains but it pours," said O'Hara,
as he entered the tent with Hope and Louisa,
while Sydney and Livingston remained to
take care of the horses. "I thought awhile
ago that I was stranded in a wilderness, and
here I am surrounded by beautiful ladies and
foine gentlemen!"</p>

<p>"Right in your natural element," commented
Hope. "That's why I couldn't believe
my eyes when I saw you out there alone
with the ax&mdash;Larry O'Hara chopping fire-wood!"</p>

<p>"Now, what's there funny about that?"
asked Larry.</p>

<p>"I can't explain just now," laughed the
girl. "But tell me, did you have any trouble
getting over here? Jim started for the ranch
this afternoon. Didn't you meet him on the
road?"</p>

<p>"Not one living soul," replied Larry.
"For I took a road nobody ever traveled before."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"And got lost," said Hope.</p>

<p>"Yes, about four hundred toimes!"</p>

<p>"And yet you live to tell the tale! I'm awfully
glad to see you, Larry! Let's have a
light in here, William, it's getting dark," she
said.</p>

<p>The cook hustled about, and soon two
lanterns, suspended from each end of the ridge
pole, flooded the tent with light.</p>

<p>"Now I can see you," exclaimed O'Hara to
Hope, who had taken a seat upon a box beside
Louisa. "You're looking foine! The mountains
must agree with you&mdash;and your friend
also," he added.</p>

<p>"Louisa is always fine! Are you not?"
asked Hope.</p>

<p>Louisa laughed in her quiet little way.
"The young man is very polite!"</p>

<p>Sydney opened the flap of the tent and
looked in, then turned back again for an
instant.</p>

<p>"That'll be all right there, Livingston.
There won't a thing touch it up that tree!
Come along in and get some chuck!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!" came the reply from the edge
of the brush. Then Carter came inside and
drew up a seat beside the two girls.</p>

<p>"What's that you said, Miss Louisa?" he
asked. "I didn't quite catch it. You surely
weren't accusing Larry of <i>politeness</i>!"</p>

<p>The girl bit her little white teeth into the red
of her lower lip. Her cheeks flushed and the
dimples came and went in the delicate coloring.</p>

<p>"Was it wrong to say?" she asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Not if it was true," he replied. "It's
never wrong to tell the truth, even in Montana."</p>

<p>"Oh, Syd, don't plague her! Larry included
her in a little flattery&mdash;a compliment;
and she merely remarked upon his extreme
politeness."</p>

<p>"And I am completely squelched," said
O'Hara despairingly.</p>

<p>"Then you shouldn't try to flatter two
people at once," declared Hope.</p>

<p>"American girls aren't so honest," said Carter,
looking soberly into Louisa's blue eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>She regained her composure with a little
toss of her head.</p>

<p>"An American girl is my best friend&mdash;you
shall say nodings about <i>dem</i>! Ah, here comes
Mr. Livingston mit de beautiful horns which
he gif to me!" she cried, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"They're beauties, aren't they?" said Livingston,
holding up the antlers to view. "I'll
get some of the Indians around here to fix
them up for you." He took them outside
again, then came in and joined the others
around the camp table.</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingston was the lucky one to-day,"
said Hope to O'Hara; "but we had a
great hunt."</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure that I got him," said
Livingston, seating himself beside her. "I
am positive another shot was fired at the same
time, but I looked around and saw no one.
You came up a few moments afterward, Miss
Hathaway, and I have had a sort of rankling
suspicion ever since that there was some
mystery about it."</p>

<p>"Then clear your mind of it at once," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>plied
the girl. "I'll admit that I fired a shot
at the same instant you did, but I was on the
opposite side of the brush from where you
were, and didn't see the antelope at all. What
I aimed at was a large black speck in the sky
above me, and this is my trophy." She drew
from her belt a glossy, dark eagle's feather,
and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"May I have this?" he asked, taking it from
her.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," she answered carelessly.</p>

<p>O'Hara had been looking at Livingston
closely, as though extremely perplexed by his
appearance. Suddenly he gave a deep laugh,
jumped up from his seat and began shaking
him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>"Well, if this isn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Edward Livingston</i>," interrupted the
other briefly.</p>

<p>"But who'd ever dream of seeing <i>you</i> here
in this country!" continued O'Hara. "It was
too dark to see you distinctly when you rode
up, or I'd have known you at once. I'm glad
to see you; indeed, I am, sir!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"How romantic!" exclaimed Hope.
"Where did you ever meet Larry, Mr. Livingston?"</p>

<p>"I had the privilege of meeting Mr.
O'Hara at the home of an acquaintance near
London two or three years ago. I am very
glad to have the pleasure again." O'Hara
was about to say something in reply to this,
but thought better of it, and remained silent,
while Livingston continued: "I never imagined
that I should meet my Irish-American
friend in this far country, though you Americans
do have a way of appearing in the most
unexpected places. This America is a great
country. I like it&mdash;in fact, well enough that
I have now become one of its citizens."</p>

<p>"But you have not left England for good!"
exclaimed O'Hara.</p>

<p>"For good, and for all time," replied Livingston,
the youthful expression of his face
settling into maturer lines of sadness. "I
have not one tie left. My friend, Carter here,
will tell you that I have settled down in these
mountains as a respectable sheep-man&mdash;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>spectable,
if not dearly beloved. Miss Hathaway
does not believe there can be anything
respectable about the sheep business, but I
have promised to convert her. Is that not so?"
he asked, turning to her.</p>

<p>"He has promised to give me a pet lamb to
take back to the ranch," she said, laughing.
"I shall put a collar on its neck and lead it by
a blue ribbon! At least it will be as good an
ornament as Clarice Van Rensselaer's poodle.
Horrible little thing!"</p>

<p>"Now just imagine the beautiful Mrs.
Larry O'Hara trailing that kind of a baist
about the streets of New York! I move that
the animal be rejected with thanks!" exclaimed
Larry. Livingston looked at him in
quiet amazement, then at Hope and Sydney
to see how they took his audacity.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Larry, dear," replied Hope.
"The pet lamb hasn't been accepted yet&mdash;or
you, either! I shall probably choose the pet
lamb, but rely on my good judgment, that's a
nice boy, and don't let such a little matter
bother you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Larry heaved an unnaturally deep sigh, at
which little Louisa laughed, and Sydney patted
him upon the shoulder, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Cheer up! You have an even chance with
the lamb. You don't need to be afraid of such
a rival!"</p>

<p>"But she says herself that the animal's
chances are the best," said Larry dismally.
Then with a sudden inspiration: "How
much'll you take for that baist? I'll buy him
of you&mdash;<i>Mr.</i> Livingston!"</p>

<p>"Now's your chance to make some money!"
cried Sydney.</p>

<p>Livingston quickly entered the mood of the
moment.</p>

<p>"Miss Hathaway has an option on the
lamb," he said, looking at her. "If she wants
to throw it up I shall be glad to sell it
to you."</p>

<p>"She wants her supper mostly now," said
Hope. "Come on, let's eat, for we must get
back. See all the fine things William has prepared
for us!"</p>

<p>After the meal, when the girls rose to de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>part,
Larry insisted upon accompanying them
home.</p>

<p>"I am going along, too," laughed Sydney,
"so I'll see that he gets back to camp all
right! You might as well let him go, Hope."</p>

<p>"Well, if he is so foolish, after his hard
day's ride," she said, with a shrug of the
shoulders. "But get him a fresh horse, Sydney.
At least we can spare the poor tired
animal!"</p>

<p>Sydney and O'Hara both went a short distance
away to get the saddle-horse which was
feeding quietly on the hillside. Hope led her
horse down to the water and while it was drinking
Livingston came and stood beside her.</p>

<p>For a moment they remained there quiet,
side by side, then the man spoke:</p>

<p>"It is of such as this that life's sweetest
moments are made. It seems almost a sacrilege
to break the spell, but I cannot always
be silent. You know I love you, Hope!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied carelessly, "I believe you
told me so once before." For an instant he
did not speak. "It was here at the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
another evening like this, wasn't it?" she continued,
in quite a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"I will not believe that you have forgotten
it," he exclaimed softly. "It may have
sounded foolish to you to hear the words, but
I could not help saying them!" He stood so
close to her that he could feel her warm breath.
"It may be wrong to stand here with you now,
alone. How quiet it is! You and I together
in a little world of our own! How I love you,
my girl, <i>love you</i>! I may not have the right
to this much happiness, but there is no moral
law that man or God has made to prevent a
man from saying to the woman he loves, 'I
love you!' Are you&mdash;do you care that I have
said it?"</p>

<p>"You must not&mdash;tell me again," she said, in
a voice so forced that it seemed to belong to
some other person. Then she turned abruptly
and led her horse past him, up the bank of the
creek, to Louisa waiting before the tent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>In the cool of evening, between dark and
moonrise, the time when night is blackest,
and shadows hang like a pall over mountain
top and crag, a small group of men might
have been seen lounging before old Mother
White Blanket's tepee, absorbing the genial
warmth that came from her camp-fire, over
which the old squaw hovered close.</p>

<p>In the background, away from the group,
yet still with the light of the fire shining
full upon him, stood the soft-voiced twin.
Suddenly the hawk-like eyes of his grandmother
swept the darkness and fastened themselves
upon his inquisitive face. For an instant
they pierced him through, then the shrill
voice rang out:</p>

<p>"So! It's only the sneak-dog that dare not
come near! You get out and hunt your bed!"</p>

<p>"I ain't doin' nothin'!" exclaimed the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! An' you'll live doin' nothin', an' die
doin' nothin', with a rope about your neck,
<i>so</i>!" She made a quick motion across her
throat, and gurgled heinously, letting her
blanket fall low upon her skinny, calico covered
shoulders, revealing a long, gaunt throat
and stiff wisps of black, unkempt hair.</p>

<p>"You don't need to think you can scare
<i>me</i>," said the boy, moving boldly forward, impelled
by fear. "I ain't sneakin' 'round here,
neither! You'd better be a little politer er I'll
tell the old man on you when he gets sober
again!"</p>

<p>"Hear him!" roared Shorty Smith. "Politer!
I reckon the school-ma'am's instillin'
some mighty high-flutin' notions into your
head, ain't she? Politer! Just listen to that
onct, will yous! Say, don't no one dare
breathe loud when <i>Mister</i> Daniel Harris,
<i>esquire</i>, comes round!"</p>

<p>"You let your betters alone," rebuked the
old woman, shaking a stick at Shorty, preliminary
to throwing it upon the fire. "My
grandson's got more in his head than all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
you!" Then nodding at the boy who, emboldened,
had come up to the fire: "Say what's on
your tongue an' git off to bed with you!"</p>

<p>The breed boy shook his head. "I ain't
got nothin' to tell," he said. "Hain't been
nowhere except over to Carter's camp awhile.
Dave and me pretty near got nabbed by a
special officer that's over there."</p>

<p>Shorty Smith raised himself up on his
elbow.</p>

<p>"A special <i>what</i>!" he demanded, while a
sort of stillness swept the circle.</p>

<p>"A special officer of the <i>law</i>," replied the
boy, with cool importance. "Dave an' me had
supper with him. He's a pretty good sort of
a feller."</p>

<p>"Nice company you've been in," observed
Shorty.</p>

<p>"Your grandmother always said you'd come
to some bad end," drawled Long Bill. An uneasy
laugh went around, then absolute silence
prevailed for several minutes. The old squaw
seemed to be muttering under her breath.
Finally she shifted her savage gaze from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
outer blackness to the faces about her camp-fire.</p>

<p>"Turn cowards for one man!" she exclaimed
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Well, Harris is in there dead drunk, and
what're we goin' to do without him, anyhow?"
exclaimed Long Bill.</p>

<p>"He might not approve," supplemented
Shorty Smith.</p>

<p>"That's right; I ain't wantin' no such responsibility
on my shoulders, <i>just now</i>," declared
the large fellow.</p>

<p>"We'll postpone matters," decided Shorty.
"I ain't after such responsibility myself, you
can bet your life!"</p>

<p>The others agreed by words and grunts.
Suddenly the old woman rose to her feet,
grasping her dingy blanket together in front
with one scrawny hand, while she outstretched
the other, pointing into the night.</p>

<p>"Git out!" she snarled scornfully. "Git
to your beds, dogs!"</p>

<p>The men laughed again uneasily.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," said Shorty Smith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
"We'll go an' see if the old man's left a drop
in his jug." He moved towards the house, followed
by the others. The soft-voiced twin
still retained his position by the camp-fire.</p>

<p>"You git too!" snarled his grandmother.</p>

<p>"I ain't no dog," replied the boy. The
squaw grunted. "You told the dogs to go,
not me! They won't find any demijohn,
neither. I cached it for <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Good boy," said his grandmother, patting
him upon the head. "Go git it!"</p>

<p>When Hope and her companions returned
that evening a couple of aged Indians hovered
over the dying embers of old White Blanket's
camp-fire, sociably drinking from a rusty tin
cup what the riders naturally supposed to be
tea. The soft-voiced twin, already curled up
asleep beside his brothers, could have told
them different, for had he not won the old
woman's passing favor by his generous act?
So he slept well.</p>

<p>So did the "old man" sleep well that night&mdash;a
heavy drunken stupor. He had returned
from town that afternoon in his usual condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>tion,
as wild-eyed as the half-broken horses that
he drove, and for awhile made things lively
about the place. At such times he ruled with
a high and mighty hand, and even the little
babies crept out of his way as he approached.
He roused up some of the idle breeds and
started a poker game, which soon broke up,
owing to a financial deficiency among them.
Then he roped a wild-looking stallion and rode
off at a mad gait, without any apparent object,
toward a peacefully feeding bunch of cattle.
He rode around it, driving the cows and calves
into a huddled, frightened group, then left
them to recover their composure, riding, still
as madly as ever, back to the stables. But the
whisky finally got in its work, and Joe Harris,
to the great relief of his Indian wife and
family, laid himself away in a corner of the
kitchen, and peace again reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Hope and Louisa very fortunately missed
all the excitement.</p>

<p>The darkness was intense when they rode
up to the ranch. Quiet pervaded the place,
and not a light shone from the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"These people must go to bed with the
chickens," remarked O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Here's some matches, Hope," said Carter,
standing beside her on the ground when she
had dismounted. "Never mind your horses,
I'll take care of them. Run right in. Such a
place for you! Darker'n a stack of black
cats! I'll stand here by the house till I see a
light in your room."</p>

<p>Just then a group of men, led by Shorty
Smith, came out of the dark passage between
the kitchen and the other part of the house,
and made their way toward the stables. The
ones in the rear did not see the riders, and were
muttering roughly among themselves. They
had been making another fruitless search for
the cattle-man's whisky, and were now going
to bed.</p>

<p>"Come back here," said Sydney, drawing
both girls toward the horses which O'Hara
was holding. They moved backward under
his grasp and waited until the men had
passed.</p>

<p>"Hope, you'll either have to change your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
boarding place or go home," announced her
cousin.</p>

<p>"I'll do neither," replied the girl decisively.
"Don't be foolish, Syd, because of a darkened
house and a handful of harmless men! I'm
not a baby, either. You'll make Larry think
I'm a very helpless sort of person. Don't believe
him, Larry! I'll admit that this isn't
always a safe country for men, but there is no
place on earth where a woman is surer of protection
than among these same wild, dare-devil
characters. I know what I'm talking about.
Home? Well, I guess not! Come on, Louisa.
See, she isn't afraid! Are you? Good-night,
both of you!"</p>

<p>"Goot-night," called the German girl.</p>

<p>"It's just as she says," explained Carter,
as he and O'Hara rode homeward. "It is
perfectly safe for a girl out here, in spite of
the tough appearances of things&mdash;far safer
than in the streets of New York or Chicago.
There isn't a man in the country that would
dare speak disrespectfully to a girl. Horse-stealing
wouldn't be an instance compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
what he'd get for that. He'd meet his end so
quick he wouldn't have time to say his prayers!
That's the way we do things in this country,
you know."</p>

<p>"It's hard to understand this, judging
from appearances," said O'Hara. "I'm not
exactly a coward myself, but I must own it
gave me a chill all down my spine when those
tough-looking specimens began to pour out
from that crack between the buildings. I'd
think it would make a girl feel nervous."</p>

<p>"But not Hope," replied Carter. "She's
used to it; besides she's not like other girls.
She's as fearless as a lion. You can't scare
<i>her</i>. If she was a little more timid I wouldn't
think about worrying over her, but she's so
blame self-reliant! She knows she's as quick
as chain lightning, and she's chockful of confidence.
For my own part, I wish she'd never
learned to shoot a gun."</p>

<p>"It strikes me she's pretty able to take care
of herself," said O'Hara. "If I were you I
wouldn't worry over it."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to get her back to the ranch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and I'm going to, too!" said Carter. Then to
O'Hara's look of wonder, "I might as well be
in Halifax as any real good I can be to her
here&mdash;in case anything should come up. You
see, there's been trouble brewing for months.
All these men around here are down on Livingston,
because he's running sheep on the
range they had begun to think was their own
exclusive property. He's as much right to run
sheep on government land as they have to run
cattle, though sheep are a plumb nuisance in
a cow country. These ranchers around here
haven't any use for his sheep at all, and have
been picking at him ever since he came up
here."</p>

<p>He then went on to tell what he knew about
the shooting at Livingston's corral.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty certain now that Hope was
mixed up in it, though Livingston is as ignorant
as can be in regard to the matter. He's
too much a stranger to the ways of the country
to learn everything in a minute. It was funny
about you knowing him, wasn't it? He's a
fine man, all right, and I hope this outfit won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
bluff him out of the country. Harris is at the
bottom of it. If it wasn't for him there
wouldn't be any trouble. Now it's my opinion
that Hope's trying to stand off the whole outfit
for Livingston's sake, and doesn't want
him to know it."</p>

<p>O'Hara was silent for a moment, then replied:</p>

<p>"I'm not the fellow to make a fuss because
a better man than me turns up. I knew in a
minute he was dead in love with her."</p>

<p>Then he told something to Carter in confidence
which caused him to pull his horse up
suddenly in the trail and exclaim: "You
don't say!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>"It is a long road," observed Mrs. Van
Rensselaer. "I had no idea it was so far.
So these are the foot-hills of the mountains.
Is this Harris place very much farther?"</p>

<p>"'Bout five mile straight up in the mountains,"
replied her companion.</p>

<p>"Then," said the lady decisively, "I am
going to stop here at this spring, get a drink,
and rest awhile; I'm about half dead!"</p>

<p>Jim McCullen made no reply, but good-naturedly
headed his horse toward a tiny
stream that trickled down a coulee near by.
Mrs. Van Rensselaer followed, heaving a tired
sigh of relief, as she slipped down upon the
moist, flower-dotted meadows beside the
stream.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is an awful undertaking," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
declared, wetting her handkerchief in the
water and carefully wiping her forehead.</p>

<p>"I thought you was pretty brave to venture
it," replied old Jim, from a short distance
below, where he was watering the horses.
"It's a hot day and a dry wind. I told you
just how it'd be."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is some comfort to you to refer
to that fact, but it doesn't make me any the
less tired or cross. Yes, I'm cross, Mr. McCullen.
It has been downright rude of Hope
to stay away like this all summer. Of course
it's possible she may have her reasons for that,
but <i>I</i> never put in such a pokey time before in
all my life! I couldn't go back to New York
without seeing her, and then Sydney told me
that if I went up there I might be able to coax
her to leave the place. But she's been there
so long now&mdash;a couple of months, isn't it?&mdash;that
I can't see what difference it would make
if she stayed a little longer. I did want to see
her, though, before I went home, so I decided
I'd undertake this journey. What about this
protégée of hers&mdash;this German girl she's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
taken to raise? Sydney said she was a pretty
little thing with hair the color of mine," shaking
back her fluff of fair hair, "and eyes like a
'deep blue lake.' That's all I could get out
of him&mdash;'eyes like a deep blue lake!' That
settles it! When a fellow begins to rhapsody
over eyes like a deep blue lake, it's a good sign
he's cast his anchor right there. Well, it'll be
a good thing for Sydney."</p>

<p>"She's a right smart young lady," remarked
McCullen. "Hope thinks a sight of her.
She can ride a little, but she ain't goin' to
learn to shoot worth a cent. Hand ain't
steady 'nough. They ain't many wimmen in
the world can shoot like Hope, though! She
beats 'em all!"</p>

<p>"You ought to be awfully proud to think
you taught her."</p>

<p>"Proud!" said old Jim, his voice deep with
emotion; "I reckon I'm proud of her in every
way&mdash;not just because she can shoot. They
ain't no one like her! I couldn't think no more
of her if she was my own, ma'am."</p>

<p>"It must be nice to feel that way toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
someone," mused the lady, from the grass.
"She thinks everything of you, too. It seems
natural for some people to take a kindly, loving
interest in almost everyone. There are
only two people I have ever known toward
whom I have felt in anything approaching
that manner. Hope and Larry O'Hara. I
have often fancied they would make an ideal
couple." Jim McCullen shook his head
doubtfully, but Mrs. Van Rensselaer, unnoticing,
continued: "And even Larry deserted
the ranch. He's been gone for two weeks.
It's about time I came to look everyone up!"
She pinned back the fluffy hair from her face,
adjusted her hat, unclasped a tiny mirror and
powder puff from her wrist, and carefully
dusted every portion of her pretty face.</p>

<p>McCullen, who had witnessed the operation
several times before along the road that day,
ceased to stare in wonderment, and very politely
looked across the rolling hills in the opposite
direction. It never occurred to Clarice
Van Rensselaer that anyone could have found
amusement in the proceedings. In fact, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
never thought of it at all, but dabbed the
powder puff quite mechanically from force of
habit.</p>

<p>After laughing to himself and giving her
time enough to complete her toilet, he led her
horse up, remarking:</p>

<p>"We'd better be movin', er like enough we
won't get there till after dark."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer sighed, regained her
feet, and suffered herself to be helped to the
saddle.</p>

<p>"I reckon you won't find O'Hara up there,"
remarked Jim McCullen some time later.
"Two evenings ago he rode over on Fox Creek,
there on the reservation, where them soldiers
are out practicin'. Lieutenant Harvey come
over to camp an' he rode back with him, bein's
he was acquainted. It ain't more'n eight mile
from camp. Mebby you could ride over there
if you wanted." This suggestion was offered
with the faintest smile beneath his gray mustache.
"It's a mighty fine chance to see them
soldiers drillin' 'round the hills, playin' at sham
battles and the like."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would probably be a pleasing sight to
see them," replied Clarice Van Rensselaer,
"but I prefer an easy chair with plenty of
cushions instead."</p>

<p>"I don't like to discourage you, but I don't
reckon you'll find many cushions where you're
goin'," said old Jim.</p>

<p>"How much farther is it?" demanded the
lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, not very fur, 'bout three mile, er a
little further," replied her companion; thereupon
Mrs. Van Rensselaer rode on for some
time in scornful, silent resignation.</p>

<p>When they reached the Harris ranch they
found groups of men lounging about everywhere.</p>

<p>It looked as though most of the inhabitants
of the mountains had congregated there on
this especial evening. Mrs. Van Rensselaer
gasped in astonishment, and even McCullen,
used as he was to seeing men gathered about
the place, looked surprised and wondered
what had been going on to bring such a
crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer gathered her skirts
closely about her, as if in fear they would brush
against some of the rough-looking men that
moved back from the path as McCullen led
her to the house. A couple of pigs chased by
a yellow pup ran past her, then an Indian
woman opened wide the main entrance of
the abode and shooed out some squawking
chickens, which flew straight at the visitor.
Mrs. Van Rensselaer hesitated in dismay,
and turned a white, startled face to
McCullen.</p>

<p>"This ain't nothin' at all," he assured her.
"Go right on in. I reckon we'll find Miss
Hope to home."</p>

<p>She drew back still farther. "You go first,"
she implored fearfully.</p>

<p>McCullen smiled, and picked his way
into the house, followed closely by his companion,
who clung to his coat.</p>

<p>Reaching the interior he seated Mrs. Van
Rensselaer upon a bench, and went in search
of the Indian woman, who had disappeared at
the first sight of the visitors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's out," he announced, returning after
a moment. "They say she and the little German
girl went out on their horses some time
ago. I suppose you'll have to wait here till she
gets back. You ain't afraid, be you?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I'll have to wait here
<i>alone</i>?" she inquired, frightened.</p>

<p>"I'll stay around fer a spell," said McCullen
kindly. "There ain't nothing to get nervous
about." He opened the door of an adjoining
room and beckoned to a breed girl, who was
lulling a child to sleep in an Indian hammock.
"Come in and keep this lady company. She's
come to see Miss Hathaway," he said. The
girl entered the room shyly&mdash;reluctantly. Jim
McCullen pulled his hat over his eyes and
turned to the door. "I'll look about a bit an'
see if she's comin'," he said, then went out of
the house.</p>

<p>The girl was shy, and stood awkwardly in
the doorway with downcast eyes, not daring to
look up at the visitor. Clarice fancied herself
too tired to talk, so sat on the bench and leaned
back against the white-washed logs. Quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
pervaded until a pig poked open the door and
looked inquisitively into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, drive that animal out!" exclaimed
Clarice, "he's coming straight at me!"</p>

<p>The girl gave the pig a poke that sent it
grunting away, then closed the door and
placed a box before it to keep it shut.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly take me to Miss Hathaway's
apartment?" asked Mrs. Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>The breed girl looked bewildered. "<i>To
where?</i>" she asked.</p>

<p>"To her room," requested the lady, less
politely. "I suppose she has a room in this
place, has she not? I should like to rest for a
few moments."</p>

<p>"It's right there," said the girl shortly,
pointing at a door.</p>

<p>"Right there!" exclaimed Mrs. Van Rensselaer
crossly. "Why didn't you tell me so
before?"</p>

<p>Clarice opened the door and gasped in
wonder. A vision of Hope's room at
the ranch, with all its dainty accessories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
came before her, and she thought of the
girl's love of luxury and comfort. Everything
was clean here, she assured herself with
another glance around&mdash;spotlessly clean and
neat, which could not be said of the room she
had just left. There was a bed, a chair, a box
and some boards covered with cheese-cloth,
that served as a dressing table. Not a picture
adorned the wall or an ornament of any
description was to be seen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer walked all around the
little room to satisfy herself that she had missed
nothing. Some newspapers were fastened to
the wall upon one side, and over them hung a
few garments, which in turn were carefully
covered by a thin shawl, with a view, no doubt,
to keep out the dust. That was probably an
idea of the German girl's, thought Clarice,
and rightly, too, for to Louisa also was due
the well scrubbed boards of the floor, the shining
window panes, and the general neatness
which pervaded the poor chamber.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer seated herself upon
a box and gazed long and earnestly at her re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>flection
in a small hand mirror which hung
over the dressing table.</p>

<p>"You haven't the features of a fool," she
remarked to herself, "but you've added two
new wrinkles by this tom-foolery to-day, and
you ought to be satisfied by this time that
you're not fit to take care of yourself! But I
suppose it's satisfying to know you're doing
missionary work. Missionary work, indeed,
for a girl who hasn't as much sense for staying
in this place as you have for coming! By the
time you get home you'll have two more
wrinkles, and it'll take a month to get back
your good looks again! Well, you always
were foolish!"</p>

<p>So saying she turned away from the mirror
and looked longingly at the bed. Just then
her eyes became fastened, wide and terrified,
upon the head of a small gray animal protruding
from the corner of the floor behind the bed.
She watched it, spell-bound by fear, as it drew
its fat body through a hole in the floor and ran
across the room. Suddenly with a terrible
shriek she threw herself upon the bed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
pack-rat ran back to its hole and made its exit
without loss of time, but Clarice sobbed aloud
in hysterical fear. Suddenly the door was
thrown open, and a weather-browned, dark-haired
girl knelt beside the bed and took the
frightened woman in her arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>"Clarice, dear," said Hope, "what <i>is</i>
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh," sobbed Mrs. Van Rensselaer,
"<i>did</i> you see it&mdash;<i>did you see it</i>? A terrible
thing! A terrible thing!"</p>

<p>"But <i>what</i>?" asked the girl wonderingly,
"what could have frightened you so, <i>here</i>?"</p>

<p>Clarice, still hysterical, only sobbed and was
quite incoherent in her explanation. Hope
looked stern, as though facing an unpleasant
problem which baffled her for the time.
Louisa had entered the room and stood quietly
to one side, looking in much surprise from one
to the other. For a moment Mrs. Van Rensselaer's
sobs ceased.</p>

<p>The German girl touched Hope gently
upon the shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tink it vas King Solomon," she said.</p>

<p>"Why, that was just it," said Hope. "You
must have seen King Solomon, Clarice. It
was only King Solomon; don't be afraid. I
thought we had the hole well plugged up, but
he must have made another one."</p>

<p>"You forget," interrupted Louisa, laughing
softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's so!" exclaimed Hope. "We
took the soap out and used it this morning because
we didn't have any other."</p>

<p>"And who's King Solomon, and what's that
to do with soap?" demanded Clarice, raising
herself upon her elbow to the edge of the bed
with a faint show of interest.</p>

<p>"King Solomon," explained Hope soberly,
"is a friend who comes to visit us occasionally,
and generally packs off what happens to be in
sight. We named him King Solomon&mdash;not
because of his solemn demeanor, but for reason
of his taking ways, and propensity toward
feminine apparel."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Hope? I do
believe this terrible place has gone to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
head! What makes all the noise in that other
room?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer seemed extremely
nervous.</p>

<p>"That's the men coming in to their supper,"
replied Hope. "I think you must have been
nervous before you saw the rat. I'm sorry I
wasn't here when you came, Clarice!"</p>

<p>"And so that horrible thing I saw was a
rat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, just a common everyday wood-rat,
for obvious reasons sometimes called a pack-rat.
But how did you happen to come up
here, Clarice?"</p>

<p>"If I had known how far it was, and what a
dreadful place I should find, I am afraid my
great desire to see you couldn't have induced
me to attempt it. How <i>can</i> you stay here? I
wish you'd go home, Hope!"</p>

<p>"Is that what you came to tell me?" asked
the girl quietly. "If so, you might just as well
get on your horse and go back. I wrote you
not to come. You might have taken my advice&mdash;it
would have been a heap better. You're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
not cut out for this sort of place. I don't
know what in the world I'm going to do with
you to-night! I'll send you back to-morrow,
that's one thing sure. One of us will have to
sleep on the floor, or else we'll be obliged to
sleep three in a bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make me a bed on the floor," offered
Louisa quickly.</p>

<p>"You won't do anything of the kind&mdash;the
idea!" exclaimed Mrs. Van Rensselaer, aghast.
"Supposing that thing&mdash;that <i>rat</i> should
come!"</p>

<p>"We'll put the soap back in the hole again,"
replied Hope. "And King Solomon will
have to keep out. Before Louisa came I used
to let him come in just for company's sake, but
the poor fellow is a hopeless case. Clarice, I
wish you hadn't come!"</p>

<p>"I wish so, too, if that will help you any,"
replied Mrs. Van Rensselaer, lifting her
pretty face dejectedly from her hands and
looking about the room in a woe-begone manner.
"I'm awfully tired, Hope, and hungry,
but I couldn't eat <i>here</i> if I starved to death!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Is that room in there <i>always</i> so grimy and
dirty? and what makes that terrible <i>odor</i> about
the place?"</p>

<p>"I think you'd better go back to the ranch
to-night," suggested Hope.</p>

<p>Clarice moaned in deep discouragement:
"Oh, if you knew how tired I am! But I
can't stand it <i>here</i>&mdash;<i>I can't do it</i>! Let me get
out in the fresh air, away from the odor of
those pigs and chickens and <i>rats</i>, and sit down
on the side of a mountain&mdash;anywhere, so that
I can breathe again!" After a moment's
pause she suddenly exclaimed: "Hope,
there's something biting me! What in the
world is it? I tell you there's an insect on me!"</p>

<p>"Fleas," said Hope briefly. "The place
is full of them. They don't bite me, and they
don't bother Louisa much either. Poor
Clarice, what trouble you have got yourself
into! I can't send you back to-night, that's
one sure thing, you're too tired." She pondered
a moment, deeply perplexed, then all at
once a solution came to her. Her eyes brightened
and she laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have it!" she cried. "I'll send one of
the boys after Mr. Livingston's buggy and
drive you over to Sydney's. They've got an
extra tent and a stack of blankets. William
will get you a fine supper, and you can be as
snug as a bug in a rug."</p>

<p>"Hope, you're the dearest girl that ever
lived!" cried Clarice. "I just dote on camping
out in a nice clean tent!" But Hope had
hurried away to find the twins before the sentence
was finished. When she returned, a few
minutes later, Clarice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But you don't intend to send me over there
<i>alone</i>, do you? You girls will go and stay
with me? Come, you must! I'll not think of
going alone. We'll have a regular camping-out
party and I'll chaperon you."</p>

<p>"Old Father Jim and Sydney are chaperons
enough," said the girl. "But we'll go
along, since you happen to be our guest."</p>

<p>This decided upon, she made Mrs. Van
Rensselaer lie down upon the bed, bathed her
pretty, tired face with cool water, and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>manded
her to rest until the twins returned
with the conveyance.</p>

<p>Louisa clapped her hands in joy at the
happy prospect of camping in a tent. She
declared in her pretty broken English that it
had been her one great desire ever since she
had been in the country. Then she became
sober again. Had not her Fritz spent months
at a time in one of those small, white-walled
tents?</p>

<p>Hope viewed the project with complete indifference.
It mattered little to her where
she spent the night, so that she got her allotted
hours of good, sound sleep. At first she was
greatly perplexed as to how she was going to
make Clarice comfortable, but now that the
matter had adjusted itself so agreeably she became
at once in the lightest of spirits, the effects
of which were quickly felt by both Mrs.
Van Rensselaer and little Louisa.</p>

<p>By the time the roll of wheels was heard,
announcing the arrival of Edward Livingston's
conveyance, Clarice was fairly rested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and in a much more amiable mood than previously.</p>

<p>"The only thing that's the matter with me
now is that I'm hungry," she said.</p>

<p>"We'll soon fix that, too," replied Hope
brightly. "The boys are back with Mr. Livingston's
team and it won't take us long to
drive over to camp. Get on your things,
Clarice." She threw her own jacket over her
arm and, picking up her hat, hurriedly left
the room. "I'll be back in a moment for
you," she said from the door. "Keep her
company, Louisa, and don't let King Solomon
in!"</p>

<p>At the entrance of the house she met the
soft-voiced twin just coming in search of her.</p>

<p>"He's out there hisself with his outfit," he
said disgustedly. "Thought it wasn't safe
fer me to drive his blame horses, I reckon!"</p>

<p>She looked out and saw Livingston standing
beside his team in the road. He was waiting
for her. When she approached, his fine
eyes brightened, but hers were gloomy&mdash;indifferent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come," he said, laughing, holding out his
hand to her. "You did not think I would
miss such an opportunity to get to see you! I
haven't pleased you, but this time I thought to
please myself."</p>

<p>"I was in such a predicament," she cried,
ignoring his hand, but forgetting her momentary
displeasure. "A guest from the ranch,
and no place to put her. Then I thought of
Sydney's, and that new tent, so we're all going
over there. I sent for your buggy, because
Mrs. Van Rensselaer has ridden a long ways,
is all tired out&mdash;but I didn't mean to put <i>you</i>
to so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Is it a <i>trouble</i> to see you?" he asked. "If
it is, I want a great deal of just that kind of
trouble."</p>

<p>"I'll go in and get her," she said quickly.
"If you will drive her over there, Louisa and I
can go horseback."</p>

<p>He assented in few words, happy to do her
bidding.</p>

<p>She started toward the house, then turned
back absent-mindedly, as though she had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>gotten
something that she was striving to recall.
Finally she gave a little short laugh,
and held out her hand. "You are very kind,"
she said, looking at him squarely.</p>

<p>He did not reply, but held the proffered
hand, drinking in the language of her eyes.
She withdrew it slowly, as if loath to take it
from his warm clasp, then flashing him one of
her brilliant smiles turned once more and went
quickly back to the house.</p>

<p>"You will ride over with Mr. Livingston,
Clarice," she announced. "He wouldn't trust
the twins with his team."</p>

<p>"And who's <i>Mr. Livingston</i>, Hope," inquired
Mrs. Van Rensselaer, adjusting her
veil carefully before the small mirror. "I
didn't suppose you had a <i>Mr.</i> anybody up here
in this terrible country! Why the prefix?"</p>

<p>"He's a white man," replied the girl, pulling
down her hat to hide the flush that crept into
her face. "An Englishman, Edward Livingston."</p>

<p>"An Englishman," mused Clarice, pulling
on her gloves. "But what makes you <i>Mister</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
him, Hope? <i>Livingston</i>&mdash;wonder if he's any
relation to Lord Livingston? <i>Edward</i> Livingston,
did you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, such a <i>nice</i> man!" exclaimed Louisa,
clasping her hands in rapture. "He is my
goot, kind friend."</p>

<p>"And Hope's too, isn't he?" laughed Mrs.
Van Rensselaer, at which remark Hope advised
her to hurry up.</p>

<p>"But my dear, I <i>am</i> hurrying just as fast
as I can," she exclaimed. "I assure you I am
as anxious to get away from here as you are
to have me. I don't see how you've ever stood
it, Hope! The attraction must be very strong.
Come, own up, is it this <i>Mister</i> Livingston?
Why, I believe you are blushing. You're so
black, though, I can't be certain. But it's a
good name&mdash;Livingston. Come on; I'm
ready to see this <i>Mister Edward Livingston</i>!"</p>

<p>The three passed out of the room and
through the large living room beyond, on out
of doors. The men had eaten their supper
and gone out to the stables, where they congregated
in numerous groups&mdash;quiet groups,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
that any other time would have seemed suspicious
to Hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer was led safely past
the pigs and dogs without accident, but at the
corner of the house she drew back, filled with
surprise, and forgetful of all danger.</p>

<p>"Hope, I do believe that <i>is</i> Lord Livingston,"
she whispered. "I knew he was out in
this country somewhere. Yes, I'm sure it is
he. His wife lives in New York now," she
rattled on; "but I don't know her except by
sight. She goes in kind of a swift set, anyway,
but he belongs to one of the best families in
England. Isn't it surprising to run across him
like this? I'll go up to him and say&mdash;why, how
do you do, Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Hope, interrupting and
taking her by the arm. "Lord or no lord,
you'll never get any supper if you don't hurry
up!" Her face had gone from red to white.
She took Clarice by the arm and led her up to
the buggy. "This is Mrs. Van Rensselaer,
Mr. Livingston," she said quickly, before
that lady could speak, then turned abruptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
about and went to the stable for the saddle-horses.</p>

<p>Livingston helped Mrs. Van Rensselaer
into the buggy, while Louisa ran after Hope,
quickly overtaking her.</p>

<p>"She says he hass a vife. I don't belief
her!" she exclaimed indignantly, linking her
arm through Hope's. "Don't you belief her
eider!"</p>

<p>"I must believe it, little Louisa, because it
is true!" said Hope. "But if it were <i>not</i> true,
if it were <i>not</i> true, I think I should be mad
with happiness at this moment!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>In a short time the horses were saddled and
the two girls dashed past the stable buildings
and the rough assortment of men who
stood silently about, past their watchful, alert
eyes, on after the buggy, which had now become
a mere speck high up on the mountain
road. As they raced by the house and tepees
the boy, Ned, cautiously raised his small body
from behind a pile of logs which edged the
road and beckoned to them frantically.
Hope's quick eye saw him, but only as the
flash of a moving picture across her mind,
leaving no impression and instantly forgotten.
But later, when she had entered the cook-tent
at Sydney's camp and seated herself among
the small company, the memory of the passing
vision came back, annoying, troubling her.
She scented danger more than she felt it. A
sense of uneasiness possessed her. She con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>demned
herself roundly for the wild thoughts
that had carried her away from herself,
and would have given much at that moment
to have known what the breed boy had
wanted to commune to her.</p>

<p>Clarice was chatting volubly to Livingston.
Sydney leaned upon the table, listening attentively.
Outside, old Jim McCullen was staking
out the saddle-horses, while about the stove
and mess-box William, the cook, flitted in
great importance. Sydney jumped up from
the table when the two girls entered and
arranged some extra seats for them, then took
one himself beside Louisa, who flushed prettily
at his attentions.</p>

<p>"We beat you by fifteen minutes!" exclaimed
Mrs. Van Rensselaer, breaking off
from her conversation abruptly. "But we
just came along spinning. And I must tell
you that I'm perfectly happy now, and don't
regret coming one bit! Just think, isn't this
luck&mdash;Mr. Livingston has promised to take
me back to the ranch to-morrow, or whenever I
decide to return! And you should see what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
splendid dinner we are going to have! After
all, I'm coming out the best in the deal&mdash;in
spite of Jim's 'didn't I tell you,' and Hope's
'what made you come.' This is a regular taste
of the real West&mdash;wild and rugged! You
don't get it at the ranch&mdash;luxurious quarters,
Chinese servants everywhere, even the people
especially imported. You might as well be in
New York for everything except the climate.
This is great&mdash;this little gulch here and these
fresh, sweet tents; but horrors, that place
back there! Isn't there any way to go around
it when we go back to the ranch, Mr. Livingston?
I don't want even to catch sight of it. I
never saw such a lot of looking men in all my
life!"</p>

<p>They all laughed at the look of abject
horror which she put upon her face&mdash;all with
the exception of Hope, who sat silently in the
shadow of Louisa and Sydney.</p>

<p>"We've been to supper," said Sydney, turning
around to his cousin, "so this is an extra
one for the special benefit of our guests.
You'd better appreciate it, for it's going to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
a jim-dandy one. Livingston's been to supper,
too, so this is just for the ladies."</p>

<p>"You're a good boy," murmured the girl,
taking off her hat and pushing back the mass
of dark hair from her forehead. "We'll soon
show you our appreciation."</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better light up, it's getting
dark a little earlier nowadays," he said, leaving
Louisa's side to light the lanterns, which
soon flooded the tent with soft radiance.</p>

<p>"I like the twilight," said Clarice to Livingston.
"But then I like lots of light, too.
Some people can talk best in the dark, but I
have to see to talk."</p>

<p>"It's only eight o'clock," continued Sydney,
from where he had left off. "Last month
it was daylight at ten. It beats all how time
flies, anyway!" He hung an extra lantern,
lighted for the momentous occasion, right
where the rays fell full upon Hope's face.
From the far end of the tent Livingston
watched her. He sought her eyes as usual.
They were everywhere, anywhere, but did not
meet his. Lately a new star had risen for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>&mdash;a
star of hope. O'Hara had told him, quite
unsolicited, that there was no attachment between
Hope and her cousin, much less an
engagement, and suddenly a new world had
opened for him.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you are lighting the lanterns
now. It isn't dark at all," said the girl,
rising suddenly from her seat. "From the
top of the ridge out there you can see the sunset,
I know."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a sunset as beautiful as
the sunrise?" asked Livingston.</p>

<p>She stopped and pondered an instant, then
glanced at him quickly, and as quickly away.</p>

<p>"No, I have not," she replied. "A sunrise
is a baptism. It is like being born into a new
world. There is nothing so beautiful, so
grand, so promising, as the vision of a new
day's sun. And to stand in the cool morning
air with the dew beneath your feet and <i>feel</i> all
the promise of that vast, golden glory&mdash;to feel
it&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped suddenly, lifting her
eyes to his for one brief instant. "There is no
moment in life when one is so near to God."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>"Admitting the sublimity and grandeur of
the time," said Clarice. "Yet who ever heard
of an enamored swain offering his heart at the
feet of his fair lady at such an unearthly hour?
It's preposterous!"</p>

<p>"In such a case he'd probably be sitting up
too late the night before," said Carter. "But
it's a pretty idea, just the same," he declared,
looking at Louisa.</p>

<p>"I think a sunset is prettier," insisted
Clarice. "I've never been able to rub the sleep
out of my eyes to appreciate the sunrise as
Hope describes it. But I think she is an exception."</p>

<p>"Would there were more then," said Livingston
fervently.</p>

<p>His earnestness seemed to amuse Clarice,
for she turned to him and laughed. Hope
swung about quickly, stung for the instant.</p>

<p>"It is sacred," she cried softly, then opening
the tent-flap with a quick movement she
stepped out into the evening.</p>

<p>Jim McCullen was putting up a new tent
down near the edge of the stream for the ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>commodation
of the ladies. The girl went over
to where he was at work and assisted him by
steadying one pole while he fastened the canvas
in position.</p>

<p>"How's the ranch, Jim?" she asked. "Mrs.
Van Rensselaer hasn't had time to tell me
yet."</p>

<p>"Well, it's about the same as ever," replied
McCullen slowly. "I reckon your father's
gettin' pretty lonesome without you. Feels
like a lost horse by now. That there little
Rosebush&mdash;Rosehill, he and them Cresmonds
have gone back East to get ready fer the great
weddin' they're talkin' about. Them folks
seem to think it's a mighty fine thing to catch
a lord er an earl. But it always seemed to me
that the Almighty left out a whole pile in order
to give some o' them fellers a title. Forgot
Rosehill's brains entirely, an' he ain't no
bigger'n a minute, neither."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, about him," said
Hope, kneeling beside McCullen as he fashioned
a stake pin more to his liking. "I hope
that outfit won't come out here another year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
I don't like them very well. It's nice and
sweet out here on the grass, isn't it? I don't
mind staying here at all to-night. I don't see
what makes me feel so sleepy and drowsy
though, but I do&mdash;sort of tired, as though I
wanted to get away and go to bed. I haven't
ridden far to-day either&mdash;only a few miles
after school. Jim, I wish I were back to-night
at the ranch&mdash;I wish I could go and say
good-night to my father, and go away to my
own room."</p>

<p>McCullen looked up from the peg he was
driving, and remarked: "I'll warrent you'll
have as good a night's sleep out here in this
tent as you would at home on the ranch.
Plenty o' fresh air an' no misquitoes to bother.
But I reckon your father'd like to see you just
the same to-night."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't want me to go home until
I've finished this school up here. I'm earning
fifty dollars a month. How much are you?"</p>

<p>"A hundred," replied McCullen. "But,
look a-here, your father <i>said</i> that, but he'd be
mighty glad to have you drop in on him one o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
these times. He's the sorriest father you ever
seen!"</p>

<p>"But I shall stay, Jim, just as long as there
is school here," said Hope decidedly. "So don't
<i>you</i> try to get me to go home. Everyone else
is. Sydney all the time, then Larry O'Hara.
I'm glad he's gone over to camp with the
soldiers. They're farther away than I
thought. Louisa and I rode over in that direction
after school, but only got to the top of the
tall butte over there. We could see them where
they were camped on Fox Creek, but it was too
far to go, so we went back to Harris'. Larry
was all the time urging me to go home while
he was here&mdash;and now Clarice has come. But
I won't go, Jim, until the school ends."</p>

<p>"Well, you just make the best of it," replied
McCullen. "I like your grit. I'm
a-goin' to stay right here so's to be near you
whatever happens."</p>

<p>"Jim," said the girl suddenly, "were you
ever nervous?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I've been, a few times," replied
McCullen. "Why, you ain't <i>nervous</i>, be you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Hopie? There ain't nothin' goin' to bother
you out here to-night. Mebby you ain't feelin'
well."</p>

<p>She smiled at his consternation. "No, I
don't think I'm nervous, Jim; just a little
restless, that's all."</p>

<p>"I expect that woman's comin' has sort o'
upset you. I didn't want to bring her, but she
managed to overrule all o' my objections."</p>

<p>He finished driving the last peg, which
made the tent secure against the strongest
wind, then straightened himself up with his
hands upon the small of his back as though the
movement was a difficult one.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I'll bring in the beddin',
an' you can fix it up to suit yourself," he said,
looking down at the girl, who had seated herself
on the grass before the tent.</p>

<p>"Listen," she whispered, holding up a
warning hand, "I hear horsebackers."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," he replied after a moment's
silence. "I reckon it's them breed boys o'
yourn. Hungriest outfit I ever seen!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, rising suddenly to her feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and peering into the gathering dusk, "that's
who it is. Go get the blankets, Jim."</p>

<p>"Where're you goin'!" asked McCullen, as
she moved quickly away down the bank of
the creek toward the dark brush of the
bottom.</p>

<p>"To tell them school's out," she replied
with a short laugh, then disappeared from his
sight.</p>

<p>"I reckon she's afraid them boys'll annoy
that Van Rensselaer woman. You'd think
she'd never seen an Injun before, from the
fuss she made back there at Harris'," soliloquized
McCullen as he brought a great armful
of blankets and deposited them inside the new
tent.</p>

<p>But Hope was not thinking of Mrs. Van
Rensselaer as she stood in the narrow brush
trail holding the bridle of an impatient Indian
pinto, while the soft-voiced twin looked at her
through the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>"There's a bright moon to-night till three
in the mornin', then it's as dark as pitch," he
was saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who figured out all that?" demanded the
girl.</p>

<p>The breed boy moved uneasily in his saddle.
"I reckon Shorty Smith er some o' 'em did,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"And they're going to meet in the sheep-shed
at the foot of the big hill," she said deliberately.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dan reluctantly, "the one
just inside the pasture fence over there on this
side. It's the nearest place to meet."</p>

<p>"How many men?" demanded Hope.</p>

<p>"'Bout a dozen, I reckon," replied the twin.
"Mebby not so many." He leaned forward
until his face was close beside the girl's.
"Say," he whispered nervously, "if they ever
found out I put you onto this, they'd finish me
mighty quick."</p>

<p>"Are they aware you know about it?" she
asked quickly. "Do they know?"</p>

<p>"You can't never tell," replied the boy deliberately,
sweetly.</p>

<p>The bushes rattled and another horse pushed
its way alongside the pinto.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we only had that Gatlin' gun now we'd
be all right," exclaimed the other twin enthusiastically,
as his horse nosed its way in beside
them. "But if we get behind the big rock
we'll scare 'em to death, so's they won't have
the nerve to do nothin'!"</p>

<p>"But what are they going to do?" demanded
Hope impatiently. "You seem to know
nothing except that they're going to meet
there for some devilishness."</p>

<p>"Goin' to make a raid on the shed, I
reckon," replied Dave. The soft-voiced twin
was silent.</p>

<p>"And you think we can stand off a dozen
men?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"They can't do a thing to us from the big
rock, anyway, an' we can watch the fun an'
pick off everyone that leaves the shed. We
can do that much," said the soft-voiced twin
eagerly.</p>

<p>"How you thirst for blood! They deserve
death, every one&mdash;<i>the dogs</i>! But I can't do it!
There must be some other way! He must be
warned, and his men too, and the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
averted. Before, it just happened so&mdash;this
time we have a chance and warning."</p>

<p>"It 'ud never do to tell him," exclaimed the
soft-voiced twin nervously. "He'd put his
own head right into the noose!"</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried. "You don't know
what courage he has!"</p>

<p>The soft-voiced twin continued to demur.
Suddenly she held up her hand to him commandingly.
"Not another word! I'll manage
this thing myself! It's for me to command,
and you obey orders. Remember, you're my
scouts&mdash;my <i>brave scouts</i>. Surely you want me
to be proud of you!"</p>

<p>"You bet!" exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>"Then do as I say," she commanded in a
voice softly alluring, coaxing. "Go home,
find out what you can, and bring me word here
in an hour. If you are not back here then I
will go down there and face them all, myself&mdash;<i>alone</i>."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," whispered the soft-voiced
twin excitedly.</p>

<p>"I <i>would</i>!" replied the girl. "Now go&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
remember I'll expect you back in one hour.
If you fail me, I'll go down there and face
those devils single-handed! I could wipe the
earth with forty such dogs!"</p>

<p>The breed boys turned away in silent, stolid,
Indian fashion, and the bare-headed girl stood
in the still gloom of the willow-brush listening
to the sound of their horses' quick hoof-beats
until the last dull thud had died in the distance.</p>

<p>"Chuck-away!" called a voice from the
creek bank.</p>

<p>"Coming!" answered the girl, turning
about with a start and running back along the
path.</p>

<p>At the bank she stopped, unnerved with a
rush of thoughts, overwhelming&mdash;terrifying.
She knelt down in the long grass, clasped her
hands over her heart as if to tear it from her,
and raised for an instant a strained, white face
to the starlit canopy of heaven.</p>

<p>"The brave can die but once," her heart
repeated wildly. "But I am a coward&mdash;I cannot
bear it! Oh, God,&mdash;if you are the great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
good God,&mdash;spare him from all harm, from
suffering and death! Spare him now! See,
I offer myself instead&mdash;freely, gladly! Take
me, but spare him!"</p>

<p>A dimly outlined face from the bank above
looked down at her, followed by a soft, mellow
laugh.</p>

<p>"The bank is so steep," said Livingston
softly. "Here, give me your hand and I will
pull you up."</p>

<p>She took a quick step upward, then stopped
just below him and looked at him intently.</p>

<p>"God in heaven," she said wildly to herself,
"I swear they shall not harm a hair of
your head! I'll tear the heart out of every
man of them that comes near you! I'll kill
them all, the hounds, the sneaks, the low
vermin!"</p>

<p>She looked at him an instant so, then
laughed&mdash;an odd, mirthless, reverberant laugh,
that echoed on the hills above.</p>

<p>"Come, let me help you," he urged gently,
reaching down his hand to her. She laughed
again, this time softly, more naturally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>"My <i>lord</i>," she said with grave emphasis,
"you honor me! I am overwhelmed for the
instant. Forgive my rudeness!"</p>

<p>"You have heard," he exclaimed regretfully.
"Your friend has told you&mdash;I am so sorry!
But then it really doesn't make any difference&mdash;only
I thought you might like me better if
you didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord," she laughed mockingly.
"I must needs <i>adore</i> you now!"</p>

<p>"Stop your fooling," he exclaimed impatiently.
"And give me your hand and I'll pull
you up here."</p>

<p>With a sudden movement he stepped down
toward her, grasping her hand firmly, drawing
her up beside him on the bank. She looked
at him in some surprise.</p>

<p>"I always had an idea," she said, "that you
were a very mild-mannered young man."</p>

<p>"But you've given me a title that I didn't
want&mdash;you've put me out of humor, and now
you must take the consequences," he said.</p>

<p>"I tried to make you angry. Why aren't
you?" said Hope seriously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Angry with you!" he exclaimed softly.
"With you, my girl! Look at me closely&mdash;in
my eyes and see the reason!" He stood beside
her. His hand grasped hers, his powerful
magnetism drew her until her cheeks
flamed, but not the flicker of downcast eyelids
betrayed more than the faintest, friendliest
indifference.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said, turning abruptly toward
the tent, "I'm starved for my supper!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>"You bad girl," cried Clarice Van
Rensselaer from the table, "why did
you run away? See this nice dinner
spoiling for you! I've regained my good
nature, which is lucky for you, but you'll have
to give an account of yourself. Actually, I
had to send Mr. Livingston to look you up!"
She glanced with a well-bred look of quizzical
amusement from Hope's brilliant, flushed
face to the man who accompanied her. "Well,
you see that I for one didn't wait for you,"
she concluded; "couldn't! I don't think I ever
was so hungry before in my whole life. Everything
tastes <i>perfectly</i> delicious!"</p>

<p>"William has outdone himself this time,"
remarked Sydney, as the girl drew up an
empty box and seated herself at the table, taking
a little food upon her plate and making a
pretense of eating. Everything tasted like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
wood. She could scarcely swallow. It finally
occurred to her that she must be acting very
unlike herself. She made a violent effort to
appear natural, succeeding fairly well.</p>

<p>"You haven't given account of yourself,
yet," said Mrs. Van Rensselaer, glancing from
her end of the table to where Hope sat, still in
silence.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," said the girl. "My excuse
would sound too trivial to you, Clarice. Perhaps
I wanted to watch the first stars of
evening."</p>

<p>"Or follow a frog to its nest in the weeds,"
supplemented Sydney, "or catch grass-hoppers
that had gone to roost, or listen to the
night-song of the cat bird in the brush or&mdash;or
what, Hopie? Maybe you were writing poems
in your mind, or preparing new lessons for
school to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it," she replied. "I was
preparing new lessons&mdash;for to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"How funny!" laughed Mrs. Van Rensselaer.
"I had forgotten you were a full-fledged
school-teacher. Of course, I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
you do have to think about your teaching
some. Goodness, I wouldn't like it at all! It
must be an awful task to bother with a lot of
rough, dirty children! How many pupils have
you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen enrolled&mdash;but only seven or
eight who attend," replied Hope briefly.</p>

<p>"Mercy, I thought you must have at least
fifty, from all I saw back there!" gasped Mrs.
Van Rensselaer. "Well, I shouldn't think it
would be much trouble to prepare lessons for
that amount."</p>

<p>"<i>That many</i>," corrected Hope. "We don't
measure them by the pound."</p>

<p>"No, we size them up by the cord," laughed
Sydney; "but we don't handle 'em, because
they're like that much dynamite."</p>

<p>"Dangerous pieces of humanity," said Livingston,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Hope can handle them all right," declared
Mrs. Van Rensselaer. "She can handle anyone,
for that matter. She's got more tact and
diplomacy than any politician. Trust her to
manage seven or eight children! Why, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
can't manage a person any other way, she'll
actually <i>bully</i> him. She can make you believe
black is white every time."</p>

<p>"Fräulein is so goot!" murmured Louisa, in
rapture.</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Hope gratefully.
"You see Louisa knows me <i>last</i>, Clarice, and
her remark should show you that I have
changed for the better."</p>

<p>"I always told you there was chance for
improvements, didn't I, Hopie?" laughed
Sydney.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have said something about there
being <i>room</i> for improvement, but I always
supposed you judged me to be a hopeless case.
I'm glad though you think there's a <i>chance</i>! I
always did want to improve!" As she spoke
she pushed back the box upon which she had
been sitting, turning it over to make it lower,
and seated herself near the corner of the tent,
where she was shaded from the direct rays of
the lantern's light.</p>

<p>More than a half hour had already passed,
she thought nervously. Then she began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
count the minutes before her messengers
should return. The time seemed endless since
she had decided to wait for more particulars
before informing Livingston of what was
about to take place. The twins had learned of
it only that afternoon, and they, though filled
with the foreboding of a desperate plot, could
tell nothing positive about the actual plans.
These she hoped they would be able to ascertain.
She believed that the soft-voiced twin
knew more than he was willing to divulge when
he advised her so emphatically against informing
Livingston of the plot. This, combined
with a certain anxiety of her own, which she
was unable to define, filled her with vague uneasiness
and decided her instantly to do
nothing until the boys returned with more
particulars.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you've finished
your supper, Hope," exclaimed Mrs. Van
Rensselaer, as the girl settled herself comfortably
in the dark corner. "<i>I</i> never was so
hungry before in all my life!" She turned to
Jim McCullen, who put his head inside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
tent: "You see, Mr. McCullen, that good,
hard, patient endeavor brings its own reward!
I wouldn't miss this for worlds!"</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it, ma'am," replied
old Jim politely. "Reckon you'll sleep pretty
well out there to-night, no misquitoes er
nothin' to bother you. The tent's all ready fer
you folks any time. Plenty o' blankets an'
it'll be a warmer night'n usual. Well, so
long!"</p>

<p>"Why, he's going away!" said Hope in surprise,
as a horse loped down the creek bank and
on through the brush trail. An impulse to run
out and call him back seized her. Sydney's
slow reply caused a delay, the impulse to do so
wavered, and in another moment it was too
late; yet she felt somehow that she had made a
mistake.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carter, after listening to
Mrs. Van Rensselaer's chatter for a moment,
"he's going over to the round-up. It's
camped about ten or fifteen miles, down at the
foot of the mountains. It's as light as day out
and much pleasanter riding in the cool of even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>ing.
He'll be back early in the morning. Had
some mail from the ranch to take over to the
boys."</p>

<p>"The poor fellows on the round-up all summer!
I bet they're glad to get their mail,"
murmured Clarice.</p>

<p>"What they get don't hurt them any," remarked
Sydney. "Range riding isn't conducive
to letter writing, and it doesn't take
long before a cow-puncher is about forgotten
by his home people, and his mail consists of an
occasional newspaper, sent by someone who
happens to remember him, and the regular
home letter from his old mother, who never
forgets. By the way, here's a lot of mail for
O'Hara. Have to ride over with it unless he
turns up pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Dear Larry!" said Clarice. "What
made him leave just when I came up here?
I'd love to see him! He's such a jolly good
fellow. You didn't send him away on some
wild-goose chase, did you, Hope?"</p>

<p>The girl shaded her eyes with her hand and
answered languidly: "No, there wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
enough excitement here, so he went over to the
military reservation. They are out on drill
over near here&mdash;Colonel Walsh, and a lot of
West Point fellows Larry knows, and so he
pulled stakes, just quit our company entirely,
and turned old Watch Eye toward Fox
Creek."</p>

<p>She drawled her words out slowly as if to
fill in time. Livingston, whose eyes constantly
sought her face, thought she must be very
tired, and rose suddenly to take his leave. She
was upon her feet in a flash.</p>

<p>"Sit right down!" she demanded nervously.
"Surely you wouldn't think of leaving us so
early; why, we'd all get stupid and go to
bed immediately, and Clarice wouldn't enjoy
herself at all!" She laid her hand upon
his sleeve entreatingly. "<i>Stay!</i>" she urged
softly.</p>

<p>"As you say," he replied. "It is a pleasure
to remain, but you must tell me when I am to
go. I thought perhaps you were tired."</p>

<p>She drew her hand away with a sudden
movement. He seated himself beside Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Van Rensselaer, who began immediately to
congratulate him upon his good sense in remaining.</p>

<p>"But it was compulsory," he returned. "I
didn't dare disobey orders."</p>

<p>"I should say not," agreed Clarice, laughing
merrily, "we always mind Hope. Everybody
does."</p>

<p>"She always knows the right," said little
Louisa, looking lovingly at her friend.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," agreed Mrs. Van Rensselaer,
"that's taken for granted."</p>

<p>Hope was again in her corner, silent, intent.
Livingston could only conclude that she was
tired. The rest of them took no special notice
of her, nor did they hear the distant splashing
of water which brought into activity all the
blood in her body and fired each nerve.
Clarice was giving an elaborate account of her
day's experience, consequently no attention
was paid to the girl's abrupt departure. She
smiled at Louisa as she passed quietly out and
made some remark about her horse, which gave
the impression that she might have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
something. At least Livingston and Louisa
received that impression; as for the others they
were busy, and besides Hope was Hope, who
always followed her own free fancy.</p>

<p>The girl fairly flew along the trail that
skirted the creek until she grasped the bridle
of a small Indian pony that was nosing its way
cautiously toward her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you!" exclaimed its small rider in
a relieved tone, as he slipped to the ground and
stood in the path beside the girl. "I was
mighty scared it might be somebody else."
Hope raised the boy's face so that the moon
shone full upon it.</p>

<p>"Ned!" she exclaimed under her breath.
"Why are you here? Where are the boys?"</p>

<p>"The old man's got 'em locked up in the
granary," he announced. Then seeing the look
of alarm that flashed into her face, added assuringly:
"But that's all right, <i>I'm</i> here!
They told me to tell you they'd get out somehow
'fore mornin'. I cached their horses in
the brush for 'em, and they're diggin' themselves
out underneath the barn. Here," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
said, handing something to her. "I got your
rifle out o' your room an' hid it under the house
soon's ever you left, an' all these cartridges. I
just knew the old man 'ud go an' look fer it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the girl, suddenly gathering
child, gun, and all into her arms. "What
a little <i>man</i> you are."</p>

<p>"Yep," said the boy, disengaging himself;
"an' I've got a lot to tell you!"</p>

<p>"And you're <i>sure</i> about this," questioned
Hope, after the boy had told a story so complete
in detail as to fairly unnerve her.
"You're <i>perfectly</i> sure that these men are
going to meet at the shed&mdash;the big shed close
to Fritz's grave, there below the ledge of
rocks?"</p>

<p>"Sure's anything," replied the boy convincingly.
"There'll be seven er eight from
our place, some from Old Peter's an' some
from up the creek."</p>

<p>Hope shivered as though it had been a winter's
night.</p>

<p>"What <i>shall</i> we do! What <i>shall</i> we do!"
she repeated almost frantically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, <i>fight 'em</i>, of course!" exclaimed the
boy. "Dave an' Dan'll get out by then, an'
we'll all lay up there behind them rocks an'
just pepper 'em! There's 'bout a million peek-holes
in that wall o' rocks, an' they can't never
hit us. Pooh, I ain't afraid o' twenty men!
We'll make 'em think all the soldiers from the
post is behind there!"</p>

<p>"The soldiers!" exclaimed the girl, filled
suddenly with a new life, "and they <i>shall be
there</i>! <i>They shall be there!</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>"You must think me rude," apologized
Hope, entering the tent as quickly as
she had left it, and seating herself
directly beside Livingston. "I surely didn't
intend to be gone so long."</p>

<p>"So <i>long</i>!" exclaimed Mrs. Van Rensselaer.
"Why, I hadn't missed you! Where
in the world have you been?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>now</i> I'll not tell you!" laughed the
girl, while her face flushed deeply.</p>

<p>"But you were missed," said Livingston.
"You've been gone just ten minutes."</p>

<p>She looked at him and smiled at her own mistake.
It seemed to her that she had been gone
an hour. He was dazzled by the unusual
brilliancy of her face, the strange light in her
eyes. The smile, he thought, was for himself.
"Did the moonlight transform you?"
he asked. She only laughed in reply. Her
heart was bounding in very joy of life now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
that she saw her way clear through the grave
difficulty that had confronted her. A great
tragedy would be averted, a lot of unscrupulous
men brought to justice, and more than this&mdash;the
boy beside her was safe. What mattered
it to her at this moment that he possessed
somewhere in the universe a wife, which
irrevocably separated her from him by every
social law and moral rule? This was nothing
to her now in view of the great sense of his
personal safety that lifted such a weight of
fear from her heart. Nothing mattered much
since he was safe. How desperate the chance
had seemed, and now how easily the danger
averted!</p>

<p>Livingston knew little of the thoughts that
played wildly in her brain while she, to all intents,
was listening with eager, brilliant face
to Clarice's light chatter. But Mrs. Van
Rensselaer was tired. Her chatter began to
fag. Outside the shadows settled down about
the tents, until the moon rose above the mountain
like a great ball of fire, casting over
everything the soft radiance of its white light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
The night was almost as bright as day. Livingston
reluctantly said good-night, and went
out with Sydney to get his horse, which was
staked some little distance away. When they
returned to saddle up a movement on the opposite
side of the brush attracted Sydney's attention,
and borrowing the horse he rode over to
investigate. Livingston, wondering vaguely
what had taken him away so abruptly,
seated himself upon the tongue of the camp
wagon and listened to the soft tones of
women's voices from the white tent near the
bank. Quite without warning a hand was laid
upon his shoulder. "Where did Syd go?"
asked Hope.</p>

<p>"Over there," replied Livingston, rising
quickly beside her, and pointing across the
brush. "He took my horse to drive out some
cattle, I think, and so I am waiting. I
thought you had retired. Did you come to
say good-night to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl softly, "what of it?"</p>

<p>"Everything! That you should care that
much&mdash;that you&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wouldn't need to care&mdash;so <i>very</i> much&mdash;to
come to bid you good-night&mdash;would I?"
she interrupted.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;perhaps; but you <i>do</i> care! I seem
to feel that you care for me&mdash;Hope!"</p>

<p>"No! I don't care for you a bit! Not at
all&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;You haven't any right to
talk to me like that! Certainly, I don't care
for you, Mr. Livingston. Oh, I didn't mean
to hurt you! I mean&mdash;&mdash;This is no time for
such things!"</p>

<p>"Hope!"</p>

<p>"Wait, listen! They will hear. See, Syd
is coming!" She stepped back from him,
pointing.</p>

<p>"What of it! You shall tell me! Look at
me!" he commanded. "Do you know what
you are making me believe&mdash;what you are telling
me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she insisted. "I am telling
you nothing&mdash;only&mdash;<i>wait</i>!" She spoke hurriedly,
catching her breath. "Before day-break
I will be on that hill over there between
your ranch and here&mdash;there above Fritz's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
grave, to watch the dawn of day&mdash;and the sunrise
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I will be waiting for you! God bless
you, dear." He kissed the brown hand, which
was snatched hurriedly from his clasp just as
Sydney rode up beside them.</p>

<p>"You mustn't believe <i>anything</i>," she gasped
under her breath.</p>

<p>"<i>Everything!</i>" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Your horse is loose, pard," said Sydney,
"I thought I caught sight of it over there, but
couldn't see anything of it when I rode over.
You're afoot! Now what are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Walk," replied the girl, darting a quick
look at Livingston. "Half a mile is <i>nothing</i>."</p>

<p>"Half a mile," laughed her cousin. "You
mean two miles and a half, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the horse isn't far! We'll find it the
first thing in the morning. Good-night, you
two! It's time school-teachers were in bed&mdash;and
everyone else. Good-night!" She turned
around and waved her hand at them just before
the flap of the white tent closed upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>Clarice yawned dismally. "Will you never
settle down, Hope? Isn't this lovely and comfortable?
So cool after the hot, fatiguing
day, I just love it! Whom were you talking to&mdash;Livingston?
What a shame he's married!
He's such a dear boy, why, I'd almost be
tempted, <i>if</i> he wasn't married&mdash;&mdash;But pshaw!
Lady Helene Livingston is one of those
frizzy-haired blondes that suggest curl papers
and peroxide, and she affects velvet dresses,
black or purple&mdash;but always <i>velvet</i>&mdash;and a
feather! I've seen her loads of times, but she
doesn't go in our set, because she's taken up
with those Grandons. You know Harriet
married an English peer, with a title, <i>nobody</i>
over there recognizes. She was such a pretty
girl that she might have done something for
her family, but I don't think the poor man
fared as well as he expected, for it's well known
that old Grandon hasn't a half a million in his
own name. But Harriet lives well, and entertains
a lot of English people nobody else
cares to have. Lady Helene Livingston is
pretty enough in spite of her velvet and feath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>ers
to get on anywhere, if only she didn't follow
in the train of Harriet's crowd. I wonder
how it happens that she never comes out
here?"</p>

<p>"The curl papers and velvet may have something
to do with that," said Hope, settling
down beside Louisa, on the opposite side of
the tent, with a motion as weary as if the only
thought she possessed was to secure a good
night's sleep. "Velvet and feathers," she
yawned. "Clarice, do you know that it's nearly
eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Really!" exclaimed Mrs. Van Rensselaer.
"I'd never have thought it. See how bright
it is in here&mdash;almost like day."</p>

<p>"Full moon," observed Hope. "It will be
light like this until almost morning, and
then darkness for a little while before daylight."</p>

<p>"How well you understand such things,
Hope! I should think it would be very difficult
to keep track of the moon."</p>

<p>"Yes," yawned the girl, "it is. We'd better
go to sleep, Clarice, because as soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
sun is up it will be too warm to stay in here, so
you won't get your morning nap. That's the
worst of a tent."</p>

<p>"What a shame!" sighed Mrs. Van Rensselaer.
Then after ten minutes of silence:
"Hope, I want you to go back to New York
with me next week. Now, no joking, dear, I
mean it."</p>

<p>"No," replied Hope. "It's too roasting hot
there at this season. I couldn't think of it,
Clarice."</p>

<p>"But we're going by way of the Lakes, and
take in a lot of those cool summer resorts.
Then I must get to Newport for the last of
the season, and after that, you know, it will be
decent weather in New York, and we can have
no end of good times. Come now, Hope, just
make up your mind to go!"</p>

<p>"You forget, I must teach my school for
several weeks yet, so that settles it. Good-night,
Clarice! Go to sleep like a good girl."</p>

<p>"What does this little school amount to, to
you?" insisted Mrs. Van Rensselaer. "Not
a thing, and you know it! You just don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
want to go with us. Come on, please do go,
that's a dear girlie!"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Clarice," replied Hope.
"There are many good reasons why I really
couldn't. This school up here, and my little
Louisa, and, anyway, I don't want to go.
Aren't you very tired and sleepy, Clarice?"
She thought Mrs. Van Rensselaer bid fair to
remain awake all night, and was devising various
schemes in her mind for getting away
from her. But Mrs. Van Rensselaer had an
object in view, and disliked exceedingly to
give it up.</p>

<p>"I really don't think you ought to stay up
here, Hope. To be candid, I don't just like
your position. Of course, in this country,
conventionalities don't count for much, but
honestly I think this Livingston is caring for
you."</p>

<p>"What in the world put such an idea into
your head?" asked the girl, flushing beneath her
cover of blankets.</p>

<p>"Hope!" reproved Mrs. Van Rensselaer.
"You know it, and I know it, so what's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
use of denying it? But, of course, if you
think it's right&mdash;&mdash;Really, I have nothing further
to say except that I wish you would return
with me, and bring your little Louisa along."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment, forgetting
her anxiety to get away, in thoughts
Clarice had suggested.</p>

<p>"Has he any family?" she suddenly asked.
"I mean&mdash;<i>children</i>, Clarice."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. But what difference
would that make?"</p>

<p>"No difference in reality&mdash;but a heap of
difference in my thoughts. If he had a
family,&mdash;children,&mdash;it would seem more natural
to think of him as being a married man, a
family man. As it is, I will remember him as
a true-hearted, free young Englishman."</p>

<p>"I think, Hopie, his being married has
spoiled a very pretty romance. I wish it
might have been different, dear!"</p>

<p>"You are too sleepy to know what you
think. Go to sleep and dream that I shall
join you in New York as soon as the school
is ended."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>It seemed an interminable time to Hope,
although it was in reality less than an
hour, before the breathing of the two
sleepers assured her that she could leave the
tent in safety.</p>

<p>When she stood outside, at the edge of the
cut-bank, casting a quick glance over the tents
behind, it seemed to her that the moonlight was
brighter than ever. It was like a soft hazy
day. She made her way toward a dark object
on the opposite side of the brush, the same that
had attracted Sydney an hour before. This
time the small object did not conceal itself,
but stood boldly forth.</p>

<p>"I thought you wasn't never comin'," said
the boy softly. "It must be 'bout mornin' by
now. Seems all night! We'll haf to ride
like blazes if we get there now in time!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
They're over here," he said, leading the way
along a winding trail around the side of a
wooded hill.</p>

<p>"You're a good boy," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You bet I had the awfulest time gettin'
away with your saddle! Every time I'd get
up near it that blame cook'd pop his head
out of the tent. I like to never got it a
tall!"</p>

<p>"But you did get it," said Hope. "I saw
that it wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Yep, an' the blanket an' bridle. I've
got 'em all cached up here in the trees&mdash;horses
an' everything, an' your horse is saddled.
Somebody rode up while I was waitin'
down there on the bank for you, an' I just had
to lay low, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Come, hurry!" whispered the girl.
"We've got to kill our horses to-night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got Dave's pinto, so I don't care,"
replied the child. Then after an instant's
pause in which they reached their horses:
"You couldn't kill this pinto, nohow!"</p>

<p>Perhaps, thought Hope, it would not kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
her horse either. She trusted not, for she
loved the animal dearly. But it would be a
ride for their very lives if the soldiers were to
reach there in time to avert the mischief.</p>

<p>It was a ride for their lives. Ten miles at
night over a rough country, through tangled
underbrush, and deep matted grass, across
stony creek bottoms and rocky hills, ever onward
toward Fox Creek at the speed of the
wind.</p>

<p>Time and again the horses stumbled to
their knees, but the riders might have been a
part of them, so securely did they keep their
seats. The pinto began to lag, at which the
girl stopped for an instant, rode behind, and
lashed it furiously with her strong quirt.
Then for a time it kept up with the thoroughbred,
but could not long continue the
speed.</p>

<p>Upon a high knoll the girl reined up, horse
and rider waiting, motionless as a carved
statue, for the pinto, whose easy, graceful running
gait had changed to short rabbit-like
leaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"Wish I had another string o' horses!"
gasped the child, as he at length gained the top
of the hill. The girl pointed down the dwindling
foot-hills to something small and white
in the distance.</p>

<p>"See, there are the tents&mdash;a mile away. The
soldiers&mdash;two troops of them&mdash;out on a pleasure
trip. I will go on&mdash;you take your time,
and go back with the men."</p>

<p>"I want to go with <i>you</i>," declared the boy,
half crying.</p>

<p>"No," said the girl coaxingly. "You must
be their guide, and lead them to the ledge of
rocks by the sheep-shed. Think how fine it will
be to be a <i>real</i> soldier." Then appalled by a
new thought: "Oh, but if you should get tired
and <i>couldn't</i> lead them there, how would they
ever find the place? <i>What shall I do!</i> I can't
wait for them&mdash;I must go back ahead. <i>If</i>
he shouldn't be there! If something should
have warned or detained him! <i>What will
I do!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, shoot it all, <i>I'll</i> take 'em there all
right!" exclaimed the boy, in a very big voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
"Don't you worry. I ain't a bit tired, an' I
ain't a-goin' to be, neither!"</p>

<p>Hope reached over and clasped the child in
her arms, a sob coming with her breath.</p>

<p>"<i>My little man!</i>" she said softly. Then instructing
him to follow her, spurred up her
horse to a fresh attempt, and so mad was her
ride that she scarcely breathed until she
dropped to the ground beside a sentinel who
commanded her to halt.</p>

<p>How she roused the camp in the middle of
the night was a story Larry O'Hara often delighted
to relate. It was Larry who really
came to the rescue, who shouldered the responsibility
of the action, and led the troops when
finally equipped to the scene of the disturbance.</p>

<p>And Hope rode back alone&mdash;rode so rapidly
that her horse stopped, exhausted, at the foot
of the big hill where she had planned
the rendezvous with Livingston. There she
left the noble animal and climbed up toward
the summit, sometimes on her hands and knees,
so tired had she become. And the moon still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
shone brightly along the horizon of the
heavens. An hour of brilliancy, she thought,
then darkness before the dawn. When she
had dragged herself up the mountain side,
hope and fear alternately filling her heart, and
hastening her footsteps, a sudden weakness
came over her as she saw on the summit the
stalwart figure of Livingston. Then it
seemed to her that the night had been a mere
dream, or at least ridiculous. How could such
a strong, brave-looking man require a girl's
assistance? It was preposterous! She seemed
to shrink into herself, in a little cuddled heap
among the rocks.</p>

<p>Then a clear whistle sounded on the still air.
She knew it was for her. How like a boy,
she thought. She tried to answer it, but could
not make a sound.</p>

<p>Finally she rose from the rocks and approached
him&mdash;not the Hope he had expected,
but a frightened, trembling girl.</p>

<p>He went to meet her, after the manner of a
boy, and clasped the hands she gave him in his
own, then kissed each one, and gravely led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
her to the summit upon which he had been
standing.</p>

<p>"This rock is like a great throne," he said,
"where we are going to wait our crown of
happiness that is to come with the rising of the
sun. Is it not so? See, you shall sit upon
the throne and I here at your feet. How you
are trembling, dear! And those heavy guns,
why did you bring them?"</p>

<p>"To protect myself, perhaps, from one who
is inclined to be over-bold," she replied, with a
little nervous laugh as she settled herself comfortably
on the throne-like rock.</p>

<p>"Hope!" he reproved. A red flush dyed
the girl's face.</p>

<p>"And are you not the man?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Tell me then," he said quietly, "who has a
better right!"</p>

<p>She drew back into the very recess of the
throne, away from his eyes, so convincingly
near to hers.</p>

<p>"It's a long climb up this steep mountain,"
she remarked weariedly.</p>

<p>"And you are tired! I can see it now. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
it was good of you to come to meet me here like
this, Hope&mdash;<i>sweetheart</i>!"</p>

<p>"No, no! you must not talk like that!"
cried the girl.</p>

<p>"You know I cannot help it when I am with
you. I must tell you over and over that I love
you&mdash;<i>love you</i>, Hope! Why not, when my
heart sings it all the time? And have you not
given me the <i>right</i>, dear?"</p>

<p>"Wait! Not now," she said more softly.
"Talk about something else&mdash;<i>anything</i>," she
gasped.</p>

<p>"And must I humor you, my queen," he
said. "Look down and let me read in your
eyes what I want to find there&mdash;then I will
talk about anything, everything, until you
want to hear what is in my heart!"</p>

<p>"Only daylight can reveal what is in my
eyes," she replied. "The light of the moon is
unreal, deceiving. Tell me how long you have
been here, and where did you leave your
horse?"</p>

<p>"You are evading me for some reason. If
I did not believe it to be impossible, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
say that I am nervous&mdash;and that you are
nervous. Can you not be yourself to me now&mdash;at
this time? Why did you want me to meet
you here?"</p>

<p>"You say you love me. Then aren't you
content to just sit here in silence beside me?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, dear, but my love is almost
too great for silence. You will admit that."
Then with a touch of amusement in his voice:
"Tell me, are you angry with me that I should
speak so plainly to you?"</p>

<p>"No, no! Of course not&mdash;only talk about
something else just now. How long have you
been here?"</p>

<p>"An eternity," he replied. "Or perhaps
longer. I'm not sure. When I left you there
at the camp I went directly back to the ranch.
The men were all in bed. I went in and got
my rifle and started over here. You see we are
both armed!" he laughed, taking a Winchester
from behind the throne of rocks. She took it
from him and examined it minutely.</p>

<p>"A good gun," she remarked, handing it
back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I started over here," he continued,
"but had a brief interruption on the road in
the shape of the old squaw that lives down in
your community&mdash;old Mother White Blanket.
She held me up in the road&mdash;positively held
my horse so that I couldn't move while she told
a story that would have brought tears to my
eyes if I could have understood a word she
said, and if my mind hadn't been so full
of the most gloriously beautiful girl in the
world.</p>

<p>"Finally I had sense enough to give her some
money, and after repeating 'yes' innumerable
times to her broken questions she finally gave
me permission to proceed on my way. I left
my horse down at the sheep-shed."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you understand anything she
said to you?" questioned Hope eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not much," he admitted, and Hope, with
a relieved little air, which he noticed, sank back
among the rocks again.</p>

<p>A silence fell over them for a time, then
Livingston raised his head and looked at the
girl intently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think she was trying to tell me something,"
he said slowly. "She said it was a
warning; but I paid no attention to her delirium.
I believe she tried to impress upon me
that I was in danger. But I was insanely
anxious to meet you. She said something that
I had heard before, that you and the twins had
driven away the men who attacked and killed
poor Fritz that night. And this much more
I think I understand now, that the 'old man,'
whoever she meant, had given her a beating,
that the twins were shut up in the stable
or somewhere, and that you were a good girl
because you had given her all your school
money. That much is clear to me now. And
also that she was very anxious that I should get
out of the country immediately&mdash;which seems
to be the sentiment of the majority of the
people out here. The old woman is no doubt
insane."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," agreed the girl, "there's not
a doubt but that she's plumb locoed! I'm
glad you didn't allow anything she said to
trouble your mind. She's a regular old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
beggar. The money was probably what she
was after. You can't believe a word she
says!"</p>

<p>"Yet she spoke convincingly," mused Livingston.
"If I hadn't been so absorbed in the
meeting I would have taken more heed of
what she said. As it was, I passed her off as a
little out of her mind. Of course, I knew you
had no hand in that shooting at the corral, had
you, Hope?" he asked in a somewhat anxious
voice.</p>

<p>"A ridiculous idea for that old squaw to get
in her head," replied the girl, leaning in a
weary fashion back upon the rock.</p>

<p>Whatever suspicion Livingston had entertained
vanished for the moment.</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said. "I don't know exactly
why, but I am glad that it isn't so. I
shouldn't like to think that you had done such
a thing&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>"The moon takes a long time to set, don't
you think?" she remarked. "It must be almost
time for daylight."</p>

<p>"Are you anxious?" he inquired pointedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
She sat erect in dignified silence and did not
reply.</p>

<p>"How much longer must you be humored,
dear?" he asked, taking both of her hands
within his own, and drawing her toward him.
"I do not believe that the moonlight will tell
lies. Look at me!"</p>

<p>She leaped away from him with all her
young strength, and stood upon the throne of
rocks, scornfully erect.</p>

<p>"How bad you are&mdash;how wicked to talk to
me so, to even think that I would care for you
one minute! Surely you must realize that I
know your past, <i>Lord</i> Livingston! <i>Your
past!</i>" she flashed.</p>

<p>"You know my past, and yet you can condemn
me," he said, pain and wonderment in his
quiet voice. "Perhaps you are right. I
haven't always been perfect. But I am not
bad&mdash;Hope! Not <i>that</i>! I am a man&mdash;I try
to be, before God. Surely you do not mean
what you say, my girl&mdash;<i>Hope</i>!"</p>

<p>"You know just what I mean," said Hope,
in a voice strained and harsh. "And you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
it would be absolutely <i>impossible</i> for me to love
you!"</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing more to be said," replied
Livingston, turning away from her.
"We will not wait for the sunrise. I will
go now." He walked from her with long
strides.</p>

<p>"Wait," she cried in absolute terror.
"<i>Wait!</i> Oh, you wouldn't be so rude as to
leave me here&mdash;<i>alone</i>!" He stopped short, his
back still toward her. "Please come back!"
she begged, approaching him, "I should die of
fright!" Somehow she reminded herself of
Clarice. "Surely you will walk back to camp
with me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, pardon me," he replied
huskily.</p>

<p>As they turned, a horse came slowly toward
them. Hope gave a little nervous exclamation.</p>

<p>"Your horse," said Livingston, reaching
for the bridle. "I thought you walked."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes," replied the girl. "I walked
up the hill. The horse must have followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
We will walk down and lead it. It's too steep
to ride down."</p>

<p>But Livingston had stopped short beside
the animal, his head bowed, almost upon the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Come, shall we go?" asked the girl nervously.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man turned to her, sternness
expressed in every line of his figure.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he commanded.</p>

<p>"For a ride," she replied, feeling for the
first time in her life the desire to scream.</p>

<p>"<i>For a ride!</i> Yes, it must have been a ride!
Your horse is nearly dead&mdash;listen to his breathing!
Crusted with foam from head to foot
and still dripping. You have been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the soldiers. To protect your ranch
from the devils who would kill you and get rid
of your sheep&mdash;this very hour!"</p>

<p>"And you have lured me here, away from
danger&mdash;away from the side of my men, away
from my <i>duty</i>, with all a woman's cowardice!
<i>But what of them!</i> You have called me bad!
That may be, but I am not bad enough to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
grateful to you for doing this, that you may,
perhaps, have intended for a kindness! Anything
would have been kinder to me than what
you have done to-night."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she cried from the
rocks where she had thrown herself. But he
was running, with all his speed, down the
mountain side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p>Then she knew that he was going
straight into the very jaws of death.
If it had been a trap set for him it
could not have been any surer. In a sheep-shed
far below, close to the reef of rocks above
Fritz's grave, a score of men were waiting,
and he was rushing toward them, down the
mountain side, lighted by the white moonlight.
And what was she doing, groveling
there among the rocks? Like a flash she was
after him, but at a speed much less than his
had been.</p>

<p>Before she was halfway down three shots
rang out. The girl clutched her heart and
listened, but not a sound could be heard save
the long echoes in the valley, which sounded
like a dying breath.</p>

<p>On she sped from rock to rock, keeping ever
out of sight of the shed, her senses keenly alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
to the one object in view&mdash;a bit of white far
below. It might have been a bunch of flowers
along the hillside, but white flowers never grew
there&mdash;a heap of bones, then, she thought.
She made a zigzag line along the jagged ridge
of rocks, closer and closer to the white object
below. She wondered if he lay on his face or
his back. How calm she was in the shock and
terror of her grief! The light of the moon was
growing dim, she had reached the very tip of
the rocks, the white object was not twenty feet
away, but out in the open in perfect view of
the sheep-shed and the score of men it hid.
Another shot broke the stillness. The white
object moved, and then a moan followed, so
low that none but the ears of the frenzied girl
could have heard. Like an enraged lioness
she sprang out into the open and dragged the
heavy body up toward the shelter of rocks.
Several bullets rang about her, but the increasing
darkness made her an uncertain target. A
couple of men ventured outside the sheep-shed,
encouraged by the stillness. The girl laughed
savagely, as if in glee, and pulled the man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
body close to the side of rocks, covering it with
her own.</p>

<p>"Come on," she cried to herself. "Come
on, show yourselves! I shall have you all! For
every pang you have made him suffer, you
shall have twenty, and for his death you shall
have a lingering one! Come on, come on!"
Three stood outside. The addition pleased
her. She laughed. Taking deliberate aim she
fired again and again. Three wounded, frightened
men crawled into the shelter of the shed.
Then a score of bullets splashed against the
rocks about her. She lifted the warm bleeding
body closer under the rocks, drawing her own
over it to protect it from all harm and talking
frantically the while.</p>

<p>"The hounds, the hounds! They murdered
you right in my sight, dear, and I will tear out
their hearts with my hands! See, they are hiding
themselves again! I can wait, yes, I can
wait! <i>My love, my love!</i> For everything
they have made you suffer! Oh, you can't be
<i>dead</i>, dear! You can't be dead! Open your
eyes and let me tell you just once I love you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Only once, dear!" She put her mouth close to
his ear. "<i>I love you, love you, love you!</i> Only
hear me once and know, dear! Know how I
love you! Why didn't I tell you? I don't care
if you are married a thousand times, a <i>million</i>
times! I love you with all my life&mdash;my soul!
See, he's trying to get away! But he'll never
reach his horse! See! A hole right through
his knee! Death is too good for them, dear.
My love, speak to me just once&mdash;only know
that I love you, that I am mad with love for
you! Tell me that you feel my face against
yours&mdash;and my kisses! See, they're crawling
out like flies! and making for their horses&mdash;and
now they're crawling back again so that
I cannot get them. Oh, God, let me get them
<i>all</i>! My love, my love, how I love you, and
<i>never told you so</i>!"</p>

<p>With the first hint of dawn another volley
came from the opposite side, and out of the
gloom a rush of cavalry closed in about the
sheep-shed, and ten men, most of them suffering
from slight wounds, were taken captive.
The man lying against the reef of rocks par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>tially
opened his eyes as Hope, with one last
kiss upon his face, rose to meet a small group
of riders.</p>

<p>"I say, Hope, it's a blasted shame we didn't
get here in time to save him!" exclaimed
O'Hara, with grief in his voice. "I'll just
send the doctor over here at once."</p>

<p>While the surgeon bent over Livingston
the girl stood close by, against the rocks, quiet
as the stone itself.</p>

<p>"A bad shoulder wound," he commented at
length. "A little of your flask, O'Hara, and
he'll be all right. Why, he's quite conscious!
How do you feel? You're all right, my boy!
A shattered shoulder isn't going to bother you
any, is it? Not much!"</p>

<p>The girl moved closer.</p>

<p>"Is he alive and conscious? Will he live?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"He's all right, madam," replied the surgeon.
As he spoke Livingston turned his face
toward her, his eyes alight with all the love-light
of his heart&mdash;answering every prayer she
had breathed upon him. Her own answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
his. Then she drew back, farther and farther
away, until she stood outside the group of
riders. O'Hara tried to detain her as she
passed him.</p>

<p>"Why, you're wounded yourself, girl!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>She looked at her sleeve, and the wet stream
of blood upon her dress, and laughed. It was
true, but she had not felt the wound.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Larry," she replied. "The
blood came from <i>him</i>," and she pointed back
to the rocks. She started on, but turned back.
"Tell me," she said, "what became of little
Ned."</p>

<p>"I sent him home," replied Larry. "The
poor little chap was about all in. We met his
uncle, Long Bill, riding like blazes for the
doctor. It seems that those young divils of
twins shot old Harris some time during the
night, which stopped that faction from joining
these fellows here as they had planned. A
pretty lucky shot, I'm thinking! They ought
to have a gold medal for it, bless their souls,
but they'll both dangle from the end of a rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
before they're forty, the devils, or I'll miss my
guess!"</p>

<p>Larry looked around to speak to an officer,
and before he could realize it Hope had disappeared,
climbing back toward the summit of
the hill where she had left her horse.</p>

<p>In the gulch on the opposite side she fell
exhausted into the very arms of old Jim McCullen,
who had returned in time to hear the
shooting, and was hastening toward the scene.</p>

<p>"My poor little Hopie!" he cried, carrying
her to the stream, where the alarmed party
from the camp found them a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>"You will drown her, Mr. McCullen!" exclaimed
Clarice Van Rensselaer, rushing up
quite white and breathless. "The poor darling,
I just <i>knew</i> she'd get into trouble with all
those dreadful Indians! Someone give me
some whisky, <i>quick</i>! That's right, Sydney,
<i>make</i> her swallow it! Here, give it to me!
<i>There!</i>"</p>

<p>Louisa, stricken with grief, pointed to the
damp, stiffened sleeve of the girl's shirt-waist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
"See," she sobbed, "they have shot her, too,
like my Fritz!"</p>

<p>Of them all, Mrs. Van Rensselaer was the
most contained, and showed remarkable coolness
and nerve in the way she ripped off the
sleeve and bathed the wound, which was hardly
more than a deep scratch, yet had caused considerable
loss of blood.</p>

<p>"It's exhaustion, pure and simple," said Jim
McCullen. Then he and Sydney drew away a
short distance, and examined the horse.</p>

<p>Hope finally looked up into the anxious
faces above her.</p>

<p>"I think, Clarice," she said, "I'll go back to
New York with you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p>Hope, a vision in white, leaned back
resignedly in the soft embrace of the
carriage cushions.</p>

<p>"I thought," she said, "you never visited
the Grandons, Clarice, particularly since Harriet
made her alliance with the titleless duke."
Mrs. Van Rensselaer smiled behind the laces
of her muff. "I didn't suppose you were
going there this afternoon," continued the girl,
with a sweeping look along the solidly built
street. "How does it happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied Clarice, "<i>Larry</i>
wished it; and you know his wish is law to me&mdash;<i>until</i>
we're married. That's only right and
as it should be&mdash;the <i>dear boy</i>!" Then impulsively:
"I don't know how I've ever lived
without him, Hope! Positively, he is the
<i>dearest</i> thing that ever lived!"</p>

<p>"And you'll both be tremendously happy, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
know. Both of you young and gay, and in
love with life and its frivolities&mdash;both the center
of your set, and both rattle-brained enough
to want to keep that center and throw away
your lives in the whirling, rapid stream of
society."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't ridicule this life, Hope.
Don't you know we are the very pulse of the
world! I had an idea you were taking to it
pretty well. You are certainly making a tremendous
hit. Even mamma smiles upon you
in the most affectionate manner, and is proud
for once of her offspring. You are simply
gorgeous, Hope&mdash;a perfect <i>queen</i>!"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes darkened, her face flushed.
"A <i>queen</i>," she retorted. "A queen! Clarice,
did you ever sit upon a throne and feel the
world slipping out from under you? A
woman is never a queen, except to the <i>one</i> man.
But you are mistaken, Clarice. I simply cannot
adapt myself to this life. If it wasn't for
the continual monotony of it all&mdash;the never
changing display of good points and fine
clothes&mdash;where even one's own prayers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
gilded and framed in consciousness and vanity&mdash;and
these streets&mdash;the reflection of it all&mdash;these
blocks and blocks always the same, like
the people they cover&mdash;presenting always the
same money-stamped faces&mdash;oh, it is this sameness
that stifles me! It is all grand and wonderful,
but it isn't <i>life</i>." She paused, then
smiled at Clarice's perplexed face. "Leave
me at mamma's when you return, for I've got
stacks of things to do, and I want the evening
all to myself&mdash;Louisa and I, you know. And
we'll say, Clarice, that I perfectly love dear old
New York."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind, dear, not at all! I know
you are no more fitted in your heart for this
life than I am for the life out there with those
<i>dreadful</i> Indians. But you've certainly been
acting superb these last two months!"</p>

<p>"You are such a <i>dear</i>, Clarice," said Hope
impulsively, stroking her gloved hand. "I
have you and Louisa, and, of course, I am perfectly
happy! I tell myself so a thousand
times a day. My poor little Louisa! <i>She's</i>
about the happiest girl I ever saw in all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
life, but she doesn't know it. Here she is
worrying her head off because Sydney is pressing
his suit too strongly and won't take 'no'
for an answer, and she thinks she ought to be
faithful to poor Fritz, her cousin, who is really
only a sweet, sad memory to her now, while all
the time she is crazy in love with Syd. Isn't it
a fright? But Sydney is way out in Montana,
and his letters serve only as little pricks to her
poor conscience. Her replies are left mostly
to me, so that is what I must do to-night."</p>

<p>"But your mother entertains this evening.
Had you forgotten?" reminded Mrs. Van
Rensselaer. "So how are you going to get
away?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I will have to come down for
awhile, but I simply will not remain long."</p>

<p>"Well, I will see you then. Larry and I
are going to drop in for a little while in the
early evening."</p>

<p>When they drove away from the Grandons'
a half hour later Clarice searched the girl's
quiet face for some expression of her thoughts,
but found none.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you have seen the Lady Livingston at
last, Hope! What do you think of her?"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders and looked
into the street. "Your description tallied very
well," she replied.</p>

<p>That evening Hope met the blond Lady
Helene at her mother's musicale. This time it
was Clarice, again, who brought the meeting
about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Rensselaer was in her gayest, most
voluble mood.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> anxious to have you two get acquainted,"
she said. "Dear Lady Helene, this
is <i>Hope</i>&mdash;Miss Hathaway, and she can tell
you everything you want to know about the
West. Do, Hope, entertain her for a few
moments until I find Larry." This the girl
did in her gracious way, but adroitly kept the
conversation away from the West.</p>

<p>After a few moments Clarice returned without
Larry. A shadow of disappointment
crossed her face as she joined the conversation.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to talk about
the West, Hope," she laughed, "and here you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
are talking <i>New York</i>&mdash;nothing but New
York!"</p>

<p>"New York is always an entertaining
topic," said Lady Helene. "I do not seem to
fancy the West particularly. You know Lord
Livingston has recently been hurt out there,
and so I do not enjoy a very kindly feeling
toward that country. The poor boy! I have
been so worried about him! Really, don't you
know, I haven't had a good night's sleep since
I heard of his injury! Yes, you know, it's a
wonder he wasn't <i>scalped</i>! It's just fearful,
really! He is so much to me, you know. Ever
since my poor husband died and the title and
estates fell to Edward, I have felt a <i>great</i>
responsibility for him. He is so much younger
than my husband, Lord Henry, and so, well,
really, sort of wild, don't you know." Here
Lady Helene smiled and wiped one eye with a
filmy bit of lace. Perhaps she was saddened
by thoughts of the havoc she had wrought in
the life of the late lord, and his fortunes.</p>

<p>Hope sat motionless, suddenly paralyzed.
"Do you mean," she asked, in short gasps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
"that Edward&mdash;Lord Livingston is not
your <i>husband</i>?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, no," replied Lady Helene, "my
husband's brother! Indeed, Edward is not
married! I doubt very much if he ever will be.
I hope if he does, that it will be to someone at
home, in his own class, don't you know!
Really, he is a great responsibility to me, Mrs.
Van Rensselaer! Why, where did Miss
Hathaway go? She seems to be such a bright,
dashing young woman. Really, one meets few
American girls so royally beautiful! Yes, as
I was saying, Edward is a terrible responsibility
to me. Even now I am obliged to hurry
away because he has just arrived here in town,
and I must meet him at his hotel. That is the
worst of not having a house of your own! To
think of poor, dear Edward stopping at a
<i>hotel</i>!"</p>

<p>"Which one?" gasped Clarice. Receiving
the information, she abruptly excused herself
from Lady Helene, who immediately decided
that some Americans had very poor
manners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>While Clarice drove rapidly toward Livingston's
hotel, Hope, in eager haste, was
literally throwing things in a trunk that had
been pulled into the center of the room. Little
Louisa, no less excited and eager, assisted.</p>

<p>"To think, my Louisa," laughed the girl,
"that we are going back to our West&mdash;<i>home</i>&mdash;again,
away from all this fuss and foolishness!
Oh, don't be so particular, dear. Throw
them in any way, just so they get in! Our
train leaves at twelve, and I have telephoned
for tickets, state-room and everything. Isn't
it <i>grand</i>? Mamma will be furious! But dear
old Dad, won't he be glad! He's so lonesome
for me, Louisa. He says he can hardly exist
there without me! And Jim, and Sydney,
and&mdash;everyone! Oh, I am wild for my horses
and the prairie again! And you've got to be
nice to Syd! Yes, dear, it's your <i>duty</i>. Can't
you see it? If you don't, the poor boy will go
to the bad <i>altogether</i>, and something <i>dreadful</i>
will happen to him! And it will be all your
fault!" Which statement sent Louisa into a
paroxysm of tears, not altogether sorrowful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will spoil dose <i>beautiful</i> clothes!"
she finally exclaimed, looking in dismay
through her tears at the reckless packer.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference," laughed Hope.
"What are <i>clothes</i>! We will have the rest sent
on after us. I suppose we've forgotten half
what we really need, but that doesn't matter,
either, does it, my Louisa?"</p>

<p>Louisa dried her tears and assisted until the
trunk was packed and strapped. Then they
took hold of hands and danced like children
around it. Suddenly Hope stopped, her face
growing white and fearful.</p>

<p>"<i>If he shouldn't forgive me!</i>" she exclaimed
softly.</p>

<p>"Ah, but he lofs you!" said Louisa.</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Van Rensselaer
opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>"My dear," she began, then stopped in
amazement. "What in the world&mdash;&mdash;Why,
you are going away!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hope, putting her head
down upon Clarice's soft evening wrap. "I
am going back to&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he has come to you, dear, and he is
waiting right here in the hall!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" breathed the girl.</p>

<p>"But he <i>is</i>!" exclaimed Clarice, gently
pushing the girl, still in all her white evening
glory of gown, into the great hall. "And he
carries his arm in a sling, so <i>do</i> be careful!"
she admonished, closing the door upon her.</p>

<p>From below came the indistinct murmur of
many voices. Under the red glare of the lamp
at the head of the broad staircase Livingston
and Hope met in a happiness too great for
words.</p>

<p>"Louisa," said Clarice Van Rensselaer,
from her seat upon the trunk, "I hope you see
it your duty to make a man of Sydney."</p>

<p>"<i>A man</i>," replied Louisa indignantly, "he
is already de greatest man in all de whole
world, and <i>I lof him</i>!"</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
